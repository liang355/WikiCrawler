<p>An <b>academic term</b> (or simply "term") is a portion of an academic year, the time during which an educational institution holds classes. The <a href="/wiki/School_timetable" title="School timetable">schedules</a> adopted vary widely.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="/wiki/Academic_quarter_(year_division)" title="Academic quarter (year division)"><b>quarter</b></a> system divides the academic year into four terms, one per season, with attendance required in three quarters per year to total 32 to 36 weeks of instruction.</li>
<li>A <b>semester</b> system divides the academic year into two terms of equal length, with attendance required in both semesters to total 32 to 36 weeks of instruction. There is often an optional summer session half as long as a full semester.</li>
<li>A <b>trimester</b> system divides the academic year into three terms of 14 to 16 weeks each, with attendance required in two trimesters per year, to total 28 to 32 weeks of instruction. The trimester evolved from the semester system in the 1960s and, thus, is compatible with it (i.e. it is simply a semester shortened from 16–18 weeks to 14–16 weeks). The spring-summer trimester may be a full trimester or may be divided into distinct spring and summer half-trimester or shorter sessions, in which classes meet double-time (or greater) to provide the same instruction that would be received in a full trimester.</li>
</ul>
<p>The word <b>quadmester</b> or <b>quadrimester</b> is occasionally used to mean either four months or (more commonly in modern American usage) a quarter of a year. In countries like <a href="/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, public universities divide the academic year into two quadrimesters (March–July and August–December).<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In most countries, the academic year begins in late summer or early autumn and ends during the following spring or summer. In <a href="/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere" title="Northern Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> countries, this means that the academic year lasts from August, September, or October to May, June, or July. In <a href="/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" title="Southern Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a> countries, the academic year aligns with the calendar year, lasting from February or March to November or December. The summer may or may not be part of the term system.</p>

<p>In most of Australia, the primary and secondary school year lasts approximately 200 days, from late January or early February to early or mid-December, and is split into four terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Term 1</b> starts in late January or early February and ends in late March or early April (often in close proximity to <a href="/wiki/Easter" title="Easter">Easter</a>).</li>
<li><b>Term 2</b> starts in late April or early May and ends in late June or early July.</li>
<li><b>Term 3</b> starts in late-July and ends mid-to-late September.</li>
<li><b>Term 4</b> starts in mid-October and ends early to mid-December.</li>
</ul>
<p>Terms 4&amp;1 (rolled over) and 2&amp;3 are respectively usually deemed 'summer' and 'winter' respectively for purposes of sports participation and uniform standards. Australian states and territories vary their approach to Easter when determining the dates for the holiday at the end of Term 1.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The exact dates vary from year to year, as well as between states, and for <a href="/wiki/Public_school_(government_funded)" class="mw-redirect" title="Public school (government funded)">public</a> and <a href="/wiki/Private_school" title="Private school">private school</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Tasmania" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> until and including 2012, the school year was split into three terms, the first one being the longest and including an extended Easter holiday (which was also the practice of mainland Australia until the mid-1980s). However, in 2013 Tasmania introduced a four-term year, to conform to the rest of the country.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> There is typically a break of two weeks mid-semester (i.e. after Term 1 and after Term 3) and a break of three weeks in the middle of the year, although this can vary between jurisdictions. In the year 2000, due to the <a href="/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics" title="2000 Summer Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a> in Sydney, the state of New South Wales extended the break after Term 3 to three weeks, compensating by reducing the break in the middle of the year to two weeks.</p>
<p>Most Australian universities have two semesters a year, but <a href="/wiki/Bond_University" title="Bond University">Bond University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Deakin_University" title="Deakin University">Deakin University</a>, <a href="/wiki/CQUniversity" class="mw-redirect" title="CQUniversity">CQUniversity</a> and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Canberra" title="University of Canberra">University of Canberra</a> have three trimesters. Unusually, Macquarie University officially uses the word "session" and CQUniversity uses the word "term" in place of "semester". Many universities offer an optional short summer semester. One recent innovation in Australian higher education has been the establishment of the fully distance–online <a href="/wiki/Open_Universities_Australia" title="Open Universities Australia">Open Universities Australia</a> (formerly Open Learning Australia) that offers continuous study opportunities of individual units of study (what are called courses in North America) that can lead to full degree qualifications.</p>
<p>Open Universities Australia operates four 13-week study periods each year. Since students study only part-time and off campus these study periods mesh reasonably easily with existing university offerings based on semesters. In some cases, a "semester" is referred to as a "Study Period", for example by <a href="/wiki/Centrelink" title="Centrelink">Centrelink</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Universities and colleges in Belgium use the semester system, dividing the academic year in two equal parts of fourteen weeks of courses. Universities start the first semester in the third week of September, and no 'autumn break'. Colleges start one week earlier, in the second week of September, giving them right to the 'autumn break' of one week. After 13 weeks of courses the 'Christmas break' starts (around December 20), which is used to study for the 3–4 weeks of examinations in January.</p>
<p>After these examinations the universities have one week of vacation, the so-called 'semestrial vacation', while the colleges start the classes of the second semester at the end of January, immediately after the examinations, which week they reclaim with the 'spring break' at the end of February, which the universities do not have. The universities start the second semester in the beginning of February.</p>
<p>Both universities and colleges have the 'Easter break', which again is used to study for the examinations in June. After Easter, the classes start again until the end of May, followed by four weeks of examinations in June, after which three months of vacation is given. The students who failed in passing some of the courses in their curriculum in January and June, the so-called 'first session', have to do the examinations again in the second session at the end of August.</p>

<p>Education being a provincial responsibility, there is no Canadian national standard. In Canada the school year for elementary and high school consists of 178 to 200 days, depending on jurisdiction, but several days may be deducted from this total for professional development and administrative duties, resulting in approximately 187 teaching days per year for most jurisdictions.

<p>Generally in English Canada, <a href="/wiki/High_school" class="mw-redirect" title="High school">high schools</a> run on a two-semester arrangement, also known as fall and spring semester, the first semester starting from the day after <a href="/wiki/Labour_Day#Canada" title="Labour Day">Labour Day</a> in September to mid-January and the second running from early February until the Thursday before the last Friday in June. The semesters are often divided into two terms each.

<li><b>Second semester</b>: from February to the beginning of June.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kindergartens usually follow a similar schedule.</p>
<p>A university academic year is slightly different because of exams. University academic year divides into:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>First semester</b>: from the beginning of October to the end of February. Some courses begin as early as September. Throughout January and February, there are usually no lessons, only exams.</li>
<li><b>Second semester</b>: from the beginning of March to the end of July. Throughout the second half of May and the months of June and July, there are also no lessons in most universities, only exams.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though September is a free month, it is officially an exam month in all Italian universities. It means that it is possible to take exams. During every exam session (January–February, May–June-July or September), students are usually allowed to take any exam of their previous carrier that they couldn't pass and even a certain number of exams of the new academic year (credit limit for this last option).</p>

Six years old is the prescribed age for admission into grade one. A national level <a href="/wiki/School_Leaving_Certificate_(Nepal)" title="School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)">School Leaving Certificate</a> (SLC) examination is conducted at the end of grade 10.These class starts in late April and finishes early March.

<p>Grades 11 and 12 are considered as higher secondary level. Higher Secondary Education Board (HSEB) supervises higher secondary schools which are mostly under private management. Previously these grades were under the university system and were run as proficiency certificate level. Though some universities still offer these programs, the policy now is to integrate these grades into the school system.These class starts from late July and ends in April.</p>
<p>Higher education consists of bachelor, masters, and PhD levels. Depending upon the stream and subject, bachelors level may be of three to five years' duration. The duration of masters level is generally two years. Some universities offer programs like M Phil and post-graduate diplomas.</p>

<p>The New Zealand school year runs from the beginning of February to mid-December, and since 1996, has been divided into four terms. By law, all state and state-integrated schools are required to be open for instruction for 380 half-days in a year (390 half-days for schools with only Year 8 students or below), meaning that the start and end of the school year is not nationally fixed to a particular date, as schools take different teacher-only days and provincial anniversary days off during the year. Schools can be exempted from opening the required number of half-days in some cases, such as in <a href="/wiki/Christchurch" title="Christchurch">Christchurch</a> in 2011 when many schools closed for up to a month after the <a href="/wiki/2011_Christchurch_earthquake" title="2011 Christchurch earthquake">2011 Christchurch earthquake</a>.

<li><b>Term 3:</b> Begins mid-July; ends mid-to-late September</li>
<li><b>Term 4:</b> Begins early-to-mid October; ends no later than 20 December</li>
</ul>
<p>If Easter falls in March or late in April, Term 1 usually ends in mid-April and Term 2 begins at the beginning of May. If Easter is in March, a 5-day half-term break then exists, with school ending on Maundy Thursday and resuming on the Wednesday. The start of term two may be delayed if <a href="/wiki/Anzac_Day" title="Anzac Day">Anzac Day</a> (25 April) falls on the Monday or Tuesday directly following the Easter break.</p>

<p>Senior secondary students (Years 11, 12, and 13) in many state schools have examination leave from mid-November, on the Thursday or Friday before the first <a href="/wiki/National_Certificate_of_Educational_Achievement" title="National Certificate of Educational Achievement">NCEA</a> external examinations begin.

<p>The Philippine school year lasts usually between nine and ten months long, and a school year must be at least 200 days as prescribed by law including examination periods. The school year begins in the first week of June and ends in the third or fourth week of March. Private schools may have a slightly shorter academic calendar either starting in the second (or third week) of June or ending earlier in March.</p>
<p>In most primary and secondary (junior high) schools, an academic year is usually divided into quarters for purposes of examination and reporting of marks though a few private schools adopt a trimestral system. Each quarter normally lasts for approximately seven (usually the 3rd quarter) to ten weeks (usually the 1st, 2nd and 4th quarters) but the actual length of each quarter and the months they cover varies among private schools. The fourth quarter for pupils in grade 6 is usually two to three weeks shorter than undergraduates to allow for preparation of final grades to determine who are eligible for graduation as well as to prepare for the graduation ceremonies themselves. Each quarter culminates in most schools with a quarterly examination period of three to five days.</p>

<p>For most universities and colleges, an academic year is divided into two semesters, each up to 18 weeks long except for senior students in their final semester where they end the semester two weeks earlier. Enrollment/registration in an institution is usually good for only one semester: a student who successfully registers for the first semester is not automatically enrolled to study in the second semester. The student will need to successfully complete clearance requirements and in a few cases, maintain a certain overall mark in order to progress in her university studies in the next semester. The first semester is followed by a break consisting of two to four weeks before the second semester, called the Semestral Break, which usually occurs between the second week of October to the second week of November for all universities and colleges. The Semestral Break can be two to three weeks long, and normally includes the All Saints' and <a href="/wiki/All_Souls%27_Day" title="All Souls' Day">All Souls'</a> holidays.</p>

Classes start in the fourth week of May and ends in the third week of April.

This allows their engineering programmes to be completed a year ahead of schools running on a semestral schedule.</p>
<p>Moreover, starting academic year 2014-2015, constituent campuses in the University of the Philippines System started their school year in August to end in May and the University of Santo Tomas started the Academic Year in August and it will end in May 2015. In AY 2015-2016, several Philippine Colleges and Universities will follow the shift.</p>
<p>In AY 2015 -2016, San Beda College Manila and St. Scholastica's College Manila will start their calendar in early July 2015 and it will end in mid- to late April 2016 and it was aimed to be a transition to a full August to May Calendar in the succeeding academic years.</p>
<p>Also in AY 2015-2016, the University of Santo Tomas, will complete its shift to an August to May calendar. Ateneo de Manila University will also shift to an August to May Calendar this AY 2015-2016 with having a summer term in June to July before AY 2015-2016 starts.

<p>In Poland, the school year begins on September 1 and ends on the first Friday after June 18. There is a Christmas break in December which lasts until after New Year's Day. There is also a winter holiday break lasting two weeks in January or February but the exact date is different for each province and the dates usually change each year. Winter break is also the dividing line between the two semesters of the school year.</p>
<p>Most universities start their courses on October 1 (at some institutions late September), and the first semester (commonly referred to as the "<i>winter term</i>") ends in January. The second term starts in February or March, (the "<i>summer term</i>") and ends in June. Each semester is usually 15 or 16 weeks long. After each of them there is an "<i>examination session</i>", when no courses are taught, which lasts up to one month. The summer break starts after the exams and lasts until the start of the next academic year. In September there is an extra examination session during which students can retake failed exams.</p>

<p>In Scotland, academic and judicial institutions traditionally organised their year into four terms:<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<ul>
<li>Candlemas: 2 February, Candlemas, which fell forty days after Christmas, marked the presentation of the infant Jesus in the temple and the purification of the Virgin Mary.</li>
<li>Whitsunday: originally a moveable term day, coming the seventh Sunday after Easter, was fixed in Scotland at 15 May in 1693. Whitsunday was originally the feast of Pentecost, around which a great many christenings would occur, so it became associated with the color white.</li>
<li>Lammas Day: 1 August, feast of St. Peter ad Vincula was a corruption of loaf-mass, the Sunday on which the first fruits of harvest were offered, first corn ground, and first loaf made. In Scotland it was associated with hand-fasting and some fairs on this day were called handfasting fairs. (Originally synonymous with betrothal, handfasting became a contract binding a man and woman to live together for a year and a day before they decided on permanent marriage.)</li>
<li>Martinmas: 11 November, was known as St. Martin in Winter or St. Martin of Tours to distinguish this from another feast of St. Martin in July.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific dates varied between institutions, and all except Michaelmas were determined by the date of Easter.</p>

<p>The school year in the United Kingdom is generally divided into three terms running from autumn to summer. For state schools, the school year consists of 195 days of which there are 190 teaching days and five <a href="/wiki/Inset_day" title="Inset day">INSET teacher training days</a>. For independent schools, the school year can be as short as 175 days. The structure of the school year varies between the constituent countries of the United Kingdom with school holiday dates varying between local education authorities.</p>
<p>Before the mechanisation of agriculture and when more of the population lived in the rural countryside, the long summer school holiday in Britain arose in the 19th century as a result of the education authorities abandoning the battle to keep children at school through <a href="/wiki/Haymaking" class="mw-redirect" title="Haymaking">haymaking</a> (around the start of August) and wheat <a href="/wiki/Harvest" title="Harvest">harvest</a> (around the end of August), when every available pair of hands was needed on the land.</p>

<p>The terms are separated by two holidays, each of approximately two weeks' duration: the Christmas holidays separating the autumn term and spring term, and the Easter holidays separating the spring term and the summer term. The period between the end of one school year and the start of the next is the summer holidays, which are six to eight weeks long.</p>

<p>The academic year originated in the pre-industrial era when all able-bodied young people were expected to work through the period of July and August. For the purposes of education, the remainder of the year was arranged into three terms accommodating the Christian holidays of Christmas and Easter. Half-term breaks divide the 16- to 17-week terms.</p>
<p>However the archaic long summer break has been criticised by educationalists in the post industrialist age because it creates a break in the academic progress.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> Even a House of Commons Education Select Committee recommended in 1999 that schools switch to a five-term academic year, abolishing the long summer holidays. Each term would be eight weeks long with a two-week break in between terms, and a minimum four-week summer holiday, with no half terms—the idea being that children can keep up momentum for eight weeks without a break.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> The proposals were introduced at a small number of schools nationally.</p>
<p>In 1999, the <a href="/wiki/Local_Government_Association" title="Local Government Association">Local Government Association</a> set up a commission to look at alternative proposals for a more balanced school year. In partnership with <a href="/wiki/Local_government#United_Kingdom" title="Local government">Local Authorities</a> and teachers unions, they were unable to agree to a suitable alternative arrangement for terms, but by 2004 came to an agreement with the <a href="/wiki/National_Association_of_Schoolmasters_Union_of_Women_Teachers" class="mw-redirect" title="National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers">National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers</a> for a standardised arrangement of school terms. Since 2004, around one third of English local authorities have signed up to the proposals which see a standard academic year agreed between the authorities, including slight variations on the traditional schemes, based on the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>start the school year on a September date as near as possible to 1 September;</li>
<li>equalise teaching and learning blocks (roughly 2×7 and 4×6 weeks);</li>
<li>establish a two-week spring break in early April irrespective of the incidence of the Easter bank holiday. (Where the break does not coincide with the bank holiday the date should be, as far as practicable, nationally agreed and as consistent as possible across all local authorities);</li>
<li>allow for the possibility of a summer holiday of at least six weeks for those schools which want this length of break.</li>
<li>identify and agree annually designated periods of holiday, including the summer holiday, where head teachers are recommended not to arrange teacher days.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition the independent schools have set their own term dates with varying degrees of local and national co-ordination.</p>

<p>The modern academic calendars used in UK academia are mainly descended from the English law court / legal training pupillage four term system:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Hilary_of_Poitiers" title="Hilary of Poitiers">Hilary</a>: January–April</li>
<li>Easter: April–May</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Trinity_Sunday" title="Trinity Sunday">Trinity</a>: June–July</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Michaelmas" title="Michaelmas">Michaelmas</a>: October–December</li>
</ul>
<p>The oldest UK universities changed this terminology over time, with Cambridge dropping Trinity Term and renaming Hilary Term to Lent Term, and Oxford also dropping the original Trinity Term and renaming Easter Term as Trinity Term, thus establishing the modern, predominant three-term academic year.</p>
<p>Most universities now operate Autumn, Spring and Summer terms of notional ten-week lengths, although some may use different names, and terms may be of uneven length, with the autumn term usually the longest. Within individual institutions practice can vary from year to year to accommodate factors such as the changing date of Easter. Some universities also have a "reading week" in which no teaching takes place at all, the equivalent of a school half term. At other universities "reading weeks" are not uniform and may be in different weeks in different faculties, departments, modules or even seminar groups within the same institution. Some reading weeks cover only seminars whilst lectures continue; others suspend both for the week. In some universities - for example, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/London_School_of_Economics_and_Political_Science" class="mw-redirect" title="London School of Economics and Political Science">London School of Economics and Political Science</a>, the Autumn, Spring and Summer terms can be referred to as Michaelmas, Lent or Hilary, and Easter or Trinity terms, respectively.</p>

<p>In the United States, the <a href="/wiki/K%E2%80%9312_education" class="mw-redirect" title="K–12 education">K–12</a> school calendar is determined by the individual states, and in some cases by the local school district, so there is considerable variation. The academic year typically consists of two 18-week semesters, each divided into two nine-week marking periods (or quarters) or three six-week marking periods, and constituting 170 to 186 instructional days (with an average of 180).<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2012)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> An instructional week is five instructional days, measured Monday–Friday at all public and most private schools; Saturday–Wednesday or Sunday–Thursday at Muslim private schools; and so on. Grades are usually reported per marking period, but major examinations are given per semester or per year.</p>
<p>The traditional start date for the school year has been the Tuesday following the first Monday in September (the day after <a href="/wiki/Labor_Day" title="Labor Day">Labor Day</a>). Though some schools still keep this tradition, many schools now start in the last two weeks of August and some schools (especially private ones) may start as late as the end of September or the first week in October. There are also some schools, especially in the southern tier of the United States, that begin at the end of July and early August. The school year ends 42 instructional weeks after it begins. Also, some schools are now moving to the first Wednesday in September (usually two days after Labor Day, unless it falls on September 1 or 2) to allow a short week as students adjust to being in school again.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/School_holiday#United_States" title="School holiday">School holidays in the United States</a> vary by jurisdiction. They include <a href="/wiki/Public_holidays_in_the_United_States" title="Public holidays in the United States">federal, state, and local holidays</a>, all or only some of which may be observed by an individual school district. In addition to these legal holidays, there are vacation periods of varying length. Most if not all schools observe the <a href="/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)" title="Thanksgiving (United States)">Thanksgiving</a> holiday, and extend it include the day after Thanksgiving since it is a Friday. There is usually a recess of about two weeks during the winter holiday period at Christmas and New Year, with a spring break in March or April that is usually correlated to the holidays of Easter and/or Passover.</p>
<p>Many schools have additional "in-service" days that are holidays for students but workdays for faculty and staff. These days are often used for parent–teacher conferences on student progress, especially in primary school. In secondary school, they are usually used as staff development days. Sometimes schools do half-day in-service days in which students are dismissed early, rather than full-day holidays.</p>
<p>Regulation of education is state jurisdiction, and most states require each school provide a minimum of 180 days of instruction per academic year. This excludes weekends, holidays and vacation periods, so the usual school year starts in late August or early September (the day after Labor Day was the traditional start date for many decades) and concludes in early to mid- or late June.</p>
<p>Unplanned vacations can extend the school year if they could have been prevented by school administrators, in theory if not in fact. Natural disasters and other incidents do not normally extend the school year because they could <i>not</i> have been prevented. Thus, if the school is closed for two weeks (10 instructional days) because the boiler has broken down, that will extend the school year by two weeks because proper maintenance could have prevented the problem. But snow storms and other forms of severe weather normally do not extend the school year because they cannot be prevented.</p>

<p>Three calendar systems are used by most American colleges and universities: quarter system, semester system, and trimester system. These are ways the calendar year is organized into a formal academic year, measured September–August or August–August. Some schools, particularly some business schools and community colleges, use the mini-mester or mini-semester system.</p>
<p>The quarter system divides the calendar year into four quarters, three of which constitute a complete academic year. Quarters are typically 10 – 12 weeks long so that three quarters amount to 30 – 36 weeks of instruction. Approximately 20% of universities are on the quarter system. Most colleges that use the quarter system have a fall quarter from late September to mid-December, a winter quarter from early January to mid-March, a spring quarter from late March or early April to mid-June, and an optional summer session. Notable users of the quarter system include the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California" title="University of California">University of California</a> system (excluding <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="University of California, Berkeley">Berkeley</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Merced" title="University of California, Merced">Merced</a>, the <a href="/wiki/David_Geffen_School_of_Medicine_at_UCLA" title="David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA">UCLA medical school</a>, and all of the system's law schools), <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford</a>, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dartmouth_College" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a>, <a href="/wiki/Northwestern_University" title="Northwestern University">Northwestern University</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_of_Washington" title="University of Washington">University of Washington</a>, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oregon" title="University of Oregon">University of Oregon</a>, and <a href="/wiki/DePaul_University" title="DePaul University">DePaul University</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Union_College" title="Union College">Union College</a> uses a modified quarter system: fall, winter, and spring terms are each eleven weeks long; there are some summer classes, but there is no official summer quarter.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> Because Union's calendar makes use of just three of four quarters, the three academic terms are generally (and somewhat misleadingly to outsiders) dubbed "trimesters," which they are not.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> Another notable and somewhat unique user of the quarter system is <a href="/wiki/Baylor_Law_School" title="Baylor Law School">Baylor Law School</a>: it operates on the quarter system while the remaining colleges of <a href="/wiki/Baylor_University" title="Baylor University">Baylor University</a> operate on the semester system.</p>
<p>The semester system divides the calendar year into two semesters of 16 to 18 weeks each, plus summer sessions of varying lengths. The two semesters together constitute 32 to 36 weeks of instruction, so that three academic quarters equal two academic semesters. Thus, academic credit earned in quarter hours converts to semester hours at ⅔ of its value, while credit earned in semester hours converts to quarter hours at 3/2 of its value. Put another way, 3 quarter hours is 2 semester hours.

(March 2012)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> universities on the semester system have a fall semester from the day after Labor Day in September to mid-December, a spring/winter semester from late January to early May, and an optional summer session.</p>
<p>In practice, the average quarter-long course is four or five units and the average semester course is three units, so a full-time student graduating in four years would take five courses per semester and three or four courses per quarter.</p>
<p>Some colleges and universities have a 4-1-4 system, which divides the year into two four-month terms (September to December and February to May) as well as a single one-month term in January in which students can do independent study, study abroad, internships, activities, or focus on one or two classes. The one-month term is sometimes called a <i>mini-mester</i>, <i>winter session</i>, <i>inter-term/interim/intersession</i> or <i>J-term</i>.

<p>Some schools have a similar format but ordered as 4-4-1, with the short term in May after the conclusion of the spring semester. The term is sometimes called either "Maymester", a <a href="/wiki/Portmanteau" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of "May" and "semester", or "May Term". Examples of schools using this system include <a href="/wiki/Wartburg_College" title="Wartburg College">Wartburg College</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bates_College" title="Bates College">Bates College</a>, Chatham University, <a href="/wiki/Clemson_University" title="Clemson University">Clemson University</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_College_of_New_Jersey" title="The College of New Jersey">The College of New Jersey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elmira_College" title="Elmira College">Elmira College</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Ohio_State_University" class="mw-redirect" title="The Ohio State University">The Ohio State University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Purdue_University" title="Purdue University">Purdue University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Transylvania_University" title="Transylvania University">Transylvania University</a>, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Redlands" title="University of Redlands">University of Redlands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Emory_University" title="Emory University">Emory University</a> and <a href="/wiki/Washington_and_Lee_University" title="Washington and Lee University">Washington and Lee University</a>'s 12-12-4 undergraduate calendar.</p>
<p>The trimester system evolved out of the semester system. It divides the academic year into three equal portions of 15 – 16 weeks each. Institutions that use the trimester system include <a href="/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology" title="California Institute of Technology">California Institute of Technology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carleton_College" title="Carleton College">Carleton College</a>, <a href="/wiki/Knox_College_(Illinois)" title="Knox College (Illinois)">Knox College (Illinois)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_University" title="Lawrence University">Lawrence University</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Merchant_Marine_Academy" title="United States Merchant Marine Academy">United States Merchant Marine Academy</a>. The fall and winter trimesters constitute an academic year of 30–32 weeks. The spring/summer trimester is usually divided into a 7.5 week Spring Session followed by a 6-week or 7.5 week Summer Session.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> The reduced maximum course load that accompanies the shortening from the traditional semester makes the trimester system compatible with the semester system. Academic credit is thus measured on the trimester system in semester hours; there is no such thing as a "trimester hour" of credit.</p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Michigan" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brigham_Young_University" title="Brigham Young University">Brigham Young University</a>, for example, the Fall trimester (informally still called 'semester') operates from September through December; the Winter trimester runs from January through April; and the spring-summer trimester operates from May through August, as two half-trimesters. Most spring-summer classes either meet double-time for 7–8 weeks in May and June or double-time/double-plus-time for 6–8 weeks in July and August (with summer half-term classes sometimes starting in the last week of June).</p>
<p>The quinmester academic calendar at <a href="/wiki/Park_University" title="Park University">Park University</a> operates with five terms per year, each lasting eight weeks (January–March, March–May, June–July, August–October, and October–December).<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>A number of colleges have adopted the "one course at a time" or "block schedule" calendar. Academic years consist of a number of terms lasting roughly four weeks each, during which a full semester's amount of work is completed in one and only one class. <a href="/wiki/Colorado_College" title="Colorado College">Colorado College</a> first began their "Block Plan" in 1970,<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> followed by <a href="/wiki/Maharishi_University_of_Management" title="Maharishi University of Management">Maharishi International University</a> in 1971, and <a href="/wiki/Cornell_College" title="Cornell College">Cornell College</a> in 1978.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Quest_University" title="Quest University">Quest University</a> in Squamish, British Columbia; <a href="/wiki/Tusculum_College" title="Tusculum College">Tusculum College</a> in <a href="/wiki/Tusculum,_Tennessee" title="Tusculum, Tennessee">Tusculum, Tennessee</a>; and <a href="/wiki/University_of_Montana_-_Western" class="mw-redirect" title="University of Montana - Western">The University of Montana - Western</a> are the only other colleges operating under this academic calendar.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.
