1. I like the main page of Bing search a lot. The background picture is aesthetically pleasing. Other features that I like are common among two engines, including the side bar info. Google also has recommended result in the box on top of all other results which is very nice
2. The most difficult part is writing code to get all the search result links from two different search engines. I need to look at the source code to find out the pattern of tag I need to target.
3. Bing search actually has done a pretty good job in terms of relevancy compared to Google. Some irrelevant results rank much higher than relevant results
