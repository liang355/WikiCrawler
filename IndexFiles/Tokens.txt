was
a
Professor
of
Computer

at
Cornell
University
Salton
was
perhaps
the
leading
computer
scientist
working
in
the
field
of
information
retrieval
during
his
time
and
the
father
of
information
retrieval
1
His
group
at
Cornell
developed
the
SMART
Information
Retrieval
System
which
he
initiated
when
he
was
at
Harvard
Salton
was
born
Gerhard
Anton
Sahlmann
on
March
8
1927
in
Nuremberg
Germany
He
received
a
Bachelor
s
1950
and
Master
s
1952
degree
in
mathematics
from
Brooklyn
College
and
a
Ph
D
from
Harvard
in
Applied
Mathematics
in
1958
the
last
of
Howard
Aiken
s
doctoral
students
and
taught
there
until
1965
when
he
joined
Cornell
University
and
co
founded
its
department
of
Computer
Science
Salton
was
perhaps
most
well
known
for
developing
the
now
widely
used
vector
space
model
for
Information
Retrieval
2
In
this
model
both
documents
and
queries
are
represented
as
vectors
of
term
counts
and
the
similarity
between
a
document
and
a
query
is
given
by
the
cosine
between
the
term
vector
and
the
document
vector
In
this
paper
he
also
introduced
TF
IDF
or
term
frequency
inverse
document
frequency
a
model
in
which
the
score
of
a
term
in
a
document
is
the
ratio
of
the
number
of
terms
in
that
document
divided
by
the
frequency
of
the
number
of
documents
in
which
that
term
occurs
The
concept
of
inverse
document
frequency
a
measure
of
specificity
had
been
introduced
in
1972
by
Karen
Sparck
Jones
3
Later
in
life
he
became
interested
in
automatic
text
summarization
and
analysis
4
as
well
as
automatic
hypertext
generation
5
He
published
over
150
research
articles
and
5
books
during
his
life
Salton
was
editor
in
chief
of
the
Communications
of
the
ACM
and
the
Journal
of
the
ACM
and
chaired
Special
Interest
Group
on
Information
Retrieval
SIGIR
He
was
an
associate
editor
of
the
ACM

He
was
an
ACM
Fellow
elected

The
Most
Influential
Paper
Gerard
Salton
Never
Wrote
This
2004
Library
Trends
paper
by
David
Dubin
serves
as
a
historical
review
of
the
metamorphosis
of
the
term
discrimination
value
model
TDV
into
the
vector
space
model
as
an
information
retrieval
model
VSM
as
an
IR
model
This
paper
calls
into
question
what
the
Information
Retrieval
research
community
believed
Salton
s
vector
space
model
was
originally
intended
to
model
What
much
later
became
an
information
retrieval
model
was
originally
a
data
centric
mathematical
computational
model
used
as
an
explanatory
device
In
addition
Dubin
s
paper
points
out
that
a
1975
Salton
paper
oft
cited
does
not
exist
but
is
probably
a
combination
of
two
other
papers
neither
of
which
actually
refers
to
the
VSM
as
an
IR
model

Interior
of
the
church
The
church
was
built
in
the
grand
market
in
place
of
the
former
Jewish
synagogue
which
was
destroyed
during
the
pogrom
of
1349
which
followed
an
outbreak
of
Black
Death
The
architect
was
probably
Peter
Parler
Charles
IV
wanted
to
use
the
Frauenkirche
for
imperial
ceremonies
which
is
reflected
in
the
porch
with
the
balcony
and
in
the
fact
that
the
church
is
relatively
unadorned
except
for
the
coats
of
arms
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
the
seven
Electors
the
town
of
Nuremberg
and
the
city
of
Rome
where
the
Holy
Roman
Emperors
were
crowned
Charles
IV
s
son
Wenceslas
was
baptized
in
the
church
in
1361
on
which
occasion
the
Imperial
Regalia
including
the
imperial
reliquaries
were
displayed
to
the
people
Beginning
in
1423
the
Imperial
Regalia
was
kept
permanently
in
Nuremberg
and
displayed
to
the
people
once
a
year
on
a
special
wooden
platform
constructed
for
that
purpose
Architecture
edit
The
Frauenkirche
is
a
hall
church
with
two
aisles
and
a
tribune
for
the
emperor
The
church
contains
nine
bays
supported
by
four
columns
The
triforium
named
the
Imperial
Loft
or
St
Michael
s
Loft
opens
on
to
the
nave
by
means
of
an
arcade
the
arches
of
which
are
filled
with
floating
tracery
consisting
of
three
rosettes
supported
by
a
segmental
arch
The
narthex
of
the
church
contains
tracery
All
three
sides
of
the
narthex
have
portals
the
jambs
and
archivolts
of
which
are
decorated
with
sculptures
The
gable
contains
many
niches
which
used
to
house
sculptures
M
nnleinlaufen
edit
The
M
nnleinlaufen
One
of
the
most
notable
features
of
the
church
is
the
M
nnleinlaufen
a
mechanical
clock
that
commemorates
the
Golden
Bull
of
1356
The
clock
was
installed
in
the
church
in
1506
The
Holy
Roman
Emperor
is
shown
seated
with
the
prince
electors
surrounding
him
The
clock
mechanism
is
activated
at
midday
when
a
bell
is
rung
to
start
the
sequence
and
is
followed
by
the
trumpeters
and
drummer
Then
there
is
a
procession
of
the
electors
around
the
figure
of
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
Organ
edit
The
organ
The
earliest
reference
of
a
church
organ
dates
from
1442
The
current
organ
was
built
in
1988
by

Early
life
edit
The
choir
of
Holy
Cross
Minster
Schw
bisch
Gm
nd
Germany
Little
is
known
about
the
earliest
youth
of
Peter
Parler
His
father
Heinrich
Parler
the
Elder
was
a
stonemason
at
Cologne
Cathedral
Around
1333
when
Peter
was
born
Heinrich
was
invited
by
the
free
imperial
city
of
Schw
bisch
Gm
nd
to
take
over
construction
of
a
large
new
parish
church
Holy
Cross
Minster
1
Peter
was
already
working
alongside
his
father
on
the
church
when
the
cornerstone
of
the
choir
was
laid
in
1351
This
is
presumably
also
where
his
apprenticeship
was
completed
The
division
of
the
choir
by
a
continuous
balustrade
demonstrates
what
would
become
his
trademark
style
The
arched
section
at
the
southern
portal
of
the
church
can
also
be
attributed
to
Peter
2
The
designs
developed
by
the
father
and
son
team
at
Holy
Cross
were
unique
and
mark
an
important
milestone
in
late
Gothic
architecture
and
sculpture
3
Peter
then
set
off
on
the
so
called
Wandering
Years
German
Wanderjahre
the
Medieval
German
tradition
of
working
as
a
travelling
craftsman
after
completing
apprenticeship
On
these
visits
he
learned
the
most
important
concepts
of
Gothic
construction
techniques
in
Central
Europe
He
visited
Cologne
perhaps
Paris
and
certainly
spent
time
in
Strasbourg
precise
knowledge
of
Strasbourg
Cathedral
can
be
seen
in
his
subsequent
buildings
4
While
working
in
Cologne
he
met
Druda
Gertrud
daughter
of
the
resident
architect
Bartholom
us
von
Hamm
They
eventually
married
and
had
four
children
three
sons
of
which
two
went
on
to
become
known
master
builders
in
their
own
right
and
a
daughter
5
While
undocumented
some
scholars
believe
Parler
traveled
to
England
during
this
period
while
others
find
the
possibility
unlikely
The
idea
arises
because
certain
detailed
and
concealed
technical
devices
appear
in
his
later
work
which
could
have
only
been
obtained
though
first
hand
experience
and
not
from
any
architectural
drawings
6
What
is
definitely
known
is
that
masons
at
Strasbourg
implemented
specific
craft
methods
from
western
England
in
the
late
1200s
which
points
to
knowledge
of
English
Gothic
architectural
methods
in
the
Rhineland
7
Since
Peter
Parler
spent
time
working
at
Strasbourg
it
is
much
more
likely
his
knowledge
of
these
methods
came
from
there
8
In
particular
the
vaults
he
later
designed
at
St
Vitus
Cathedral
were
most
probably
modeled
after
the
St
Catherine
Chapel
of
Strasbourg
Cathedral
9
Nuremberg
edit
Frauenkirche
Nuremberg
Germany
where
the
first
sculpture
by
Peter
Parler
can
be
directly
identified
1352
1356
Sometime
after
1352
Peter
joined
the
construction
works
at
the
Frauenkirche
in
Nuremberg
as
the
parlier
or
chief
site
assistant
alongside
his
father
The
exact
date
and
his
precise
role
are
unclear
The
foundations
of
the
church
had
already
been
laid
in
1351
on
the
initiative
of
Charles
IV
Holy
Roman
Emperor
who
envisioned
it
as
a
center
for
holding
imperial
ceremonies
This
is
reflected
in
the
carved
coats
of
arms
of
the
Emperor
the
seven
Prince
electors
and
the
city
of
Rome
where
the
Holy
Roman
Emperors
were
crowned
Here
the
first
sculptures
can
be
directly
ascribed
to
Peter
among
them
a
prominent
figure
of
Zacharias
8
Charles
also
commissioned
the
building
of
Wenzelsburg

Built
on
the
ruins
of
an
older
castle
its
ambitious
architecture
can
be
directly
connected
to
the
Parlers
and
Peter
probably
worked
there
as
a
sculptor
4
By
1355
their
sophisticated
style
had
come
to
the
attention
of
Charles
IV
and
Peter
was
called
to
work
in
Prague
the
capitol
of
the
new
Kingdom
of
Bohemia
and
seat
of
the
Emperor
The
year
of
this
appointment
is
not
entirely
clear
since
the
documentary
inscription
in
Prague
was
partially
painted
over
in
the
15th
century
Today
research
usually
sets
the
date
to
1356
11
which
accounts
for
a
pause
in
construction
in
both
Nuremberg
and
Prague
as
well
as
information
that
he
was
at
least
23
years
old
at
the
time
of
his
appointment

History
of
Prague
Renaissance
Upon
his
ascension
to
the
throne
as
King
of
Bohemia
in
1347
Charles
IV
established
his
capitol
at
Prague
At
the
time
it
consisted
of
two
autonomous
Medieval
towns
on
each
side
of
the
Vltava
river
German
Moldau
the
Old
Town
on
the
right
and
the
Mal
Strana
with
Prague
Castle
above
it
on
the
left
In
1348
he
ordered
construction
of
the
New
Town
adjacent
to
the
existing
Old
Town
founded
Charles
University
began
reconstruction
of
the
castle
and
restarted
work
on
the
cathedral
To
accomplish
this
ambitious
building
program
he
recruited
the
best
architects
he
could
find
First
was
Matthias
of
Arras
who
died
in
1352
When
elected
Holy
Roman
Emperor
in
1355
Charles
determined
to
make
Prague
the
showcase
capitol
of
Central
Europe
and
recruited
Peter
Parler
to
execute
this
grand
vision
The
period
would
launch
what
became
known
as
Prague
s
golden
era
and
it
soon
was
the
largest
European
city
after
Constantinople
Paris
and
Granada

St
Vitus
Cathedral

Main
article
St
Vitus
Cathedral
When
Peter
arrived
in
Prague
in
1356
at
the
age
of
23
his
immediate
assignment
was
to
take
over
the
construction
site
at
St
Vitus
Cathedral
which
had
languished
since
the
death
of
Matthias
of
Arras
in
1352
It
is
indicative
of
Peter
s
talents
that
the
most
important
building
in
the
Empire
was
then
entrusted
to
such
a
young
architect
4
13
Peter
continued
the
works
at
St
Vitus
from
the
ambulatory
and
chapels
which
were
partially
complete
and
gradually
changed
the
Matthias
plan
while
keeping
continual
references
to
the
original
vision

Charles
Bridge
In
1342
just
prior
to
the
reign
of
Charles
IV
the
Romanesque
Judith
Bridge
across
the
Vltava
was
severely
damaged
in
a
flood
It
had
been
the
first
stone
bridge
to
connect
each
bank
of
the
river
In
1357
Charles
commissioned
Peter
to
build
a
new
structure
to
reconnect
the
growing
city
now
consisting
of
4
districts
The
first
foundation
stone
was
ceremonially
laid
in
the
presence
of
the
Emperor
on
9
July
1357
at
5
31
am
The
exact
time
is
known
because
the
architect
had
the
palindromic
number
135797531
carved
into
the
bridge
s
tower
having
been
chosen
by
the
royal
astrologists
as
the
most
auspicious
for
starting
construction
Due
to
the
complexity
of
the
engineering
project
and
the
large
number
of
other
projects
underway
construction
lasted
until
1402
14
The
east
tower
of
the
Bridge
Old
Town
Bridge
Tower
was
also
built
by
Peter
Parler
Its
arch
contains
a
net
vault
that
was
the
first
of
its
kind
in
Bohemia
15
Other
Works
edit
Apart
from
the
cathedral
and
the
bridge
Peter
was
also
the
main
designer
of
the
New
Town
of
Prague
He
also
built
the
All
Saints
Chapel
inside
the
Royal
Palace
of
Prague
Castle
After
a
fire
in
1541
it
was
redecorated
in
the
Baroque
style
Between
1360
78
Parler
built
the
chancel
of
the
St
Bartholomew
church
in
Kol
n
Peter
is
also
responsible
for
various
tombs
shrines
and
sculptures
at
various
sites
in
and
around
Prague
including
at
Kutn
Hora

Tomb
of
Peter
Parler
in
St
Vitus
Cathedral
The
Parler
family
grew
large
and
its
many
members
worked
at
Gothic
construction
sites
all
over
Central
Europe
and
Northern
Italy
Peter
s
branch
of
the
family
began
with
his
marriage
to
his
first
wife
Gertrude
Although
their
wedding
date
is
not
exactly
known
by
1360
they
were
raising
three
sons
and
a
daughter
Johann
Parler
the
Younger
born
around
1359
educated
in
Prague
worked
alongside
his
father
on
St
Vitus
Johann
took
over
his
father
s
role
as
the
cathedral
s
master
builder
in
1398
and
also
became
the
master
builder
of
St
Barbara
s
Church
Kutn
Hora
now
a
UNESCO
World
Heritage
Site
17
Nikolaus
Parler
became
a
clergyman
and
served
as
a
canon
in
Prague
from
1380
1398
Little
else
is
known
about
him
5
Wenzel
Parler
born
around
1360
also
educated
in
Prague
worked
with
both
his
father
and
brother
Johann
at
St
Vitus
through
the
1390s
He
then
went
on
to
become
master
stonemason
at
St
Stephen
s
Cathedral
Vienna
18
Their
daughter
appears
around
1383
as
the
wife
of
a
Michael
from
Cologne
possibly
the
son
of
another
cathedral
architect
named
Michael
1364
1387
5
After
1360
Peter
owned
a
house
in
Prague
Castle
Square
and
had
been
elected
city
alderman
His
first
wife
Gertrude
died
in
the
late
1360s
and
he
returned
to
Cologne
to
dispose
of
her
inheritance
in
1370
He
then
married
Elisabeth
Agnes
von
Bur
in
1380
and
in
the
same
year
bought
a
second
house
on
Castle
Square
From
this
marriage
two
more
children
were
born
Johann
who
possibly
became
a
stonemason
in
Zagreb
and
Paul
about
whom
no
information
survives
19
He
may
have
had
other
children
as
well
5
The
purchase
of
the
houses
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
and
the
number
of
his
children
led
to
some
legal
disputes
Peter
Parler
is
known
to
have
relinquished
both
houses
to
his
second
wife
and
their
children
20
Peter
was
granted
citizenship
in
Prague
in
1379
4
By
his
old
age
he
had
become
a
wealthy
man
and
was
still
active
as
an
architect
His
name
appears
as
Cathedral
Master
German
Dombaumeister
on
a
panel
at
St
Vitus
as
late
as
1396
21
He
died
in
Prague
in
1399
and
was
buried
at
St
Vitus
Cathedral
with
his
sons
Peter
and
Wenzel
carrying
on
his
work
Legacy

Peter
Parler
was
one
of
the
most
well
known
and
influential
craftsman
of
the
Middle
Ages
13
22
The
designs
of
both
he
and
his
father
became
known
as
the
Parler
style
and
spread
throughout
Central
Europe
Significant
examples
include
St
Martin
s
Church
Landshut
begun
1389
St

to
Poland
Examples
can
also
be
found
in
Scandinavia
such
as
at
St

Denmark
23
A
demonstration
of
just
how
far
his
ideas
went
can
be
found
at
Seville
Cathedral
begun
in
1402
and
today
still
the
largest
Gothic
cathedral
in
the
world
24
The
standard
Gothic
verticality
of
the
central
space
is
broken
up
by
a
balustrade
at
the
boundary
with
the
clerestory
windows
More
importantly
the
balustrade
s
widely
spaced
vertical
bars
and
its
position
flowing
outside
of
the
outermost
ribs
are
exactly
like
Peter
Parler
s
original
design
of
the
western
bays
at
St
Vitus
Cathedral
25
Construction
at
Seville
Cathedral
continued
until
1506
During
the
Hussite
wars
1419
1434
the
lands
of
the
Bohemian
Crown
were
totally
ravaged
Although
his
buildings
still
stand
much
of
Peter
Parler
s
sculptural
works
were
destroyed

great
granddaughter
of
the
Grand
Duke
of
Lithuania
Gediminas
He
was
named
after
Saint
Sigismund
of
Burgundy
From
Sigismund
s
childhood
he
was
nicknamed
the
ginger

ry
av
in
the
Crown
of
Bohemia
on
account
of
his
hair
colour
Mary
of
Hungary
King
Louis
the
Great
of
Hungary
and
Poland
always
had
a
good
and
close
relationship
with
Emperor
Charles
IV
and
Sigismund
was
betrothed
to
Louis
eldest
daughter
Mary
in
1374
when
he
was
six
years
old
Upon
his
father
s
death
in
1378
young
Sigismund
became
Margrave
of
Brandenburg
and
was
sent
to
the
Hungarian
court
where
he
soon
learnt
the
Hungarian
language
and
way
of
life
and
became
entirely
devoted
to
his
adopted
country
King
Louis
named
him
as
his
heir
and
appointed
him
his
successor
as
King
of
Hungary
In
1381
the
then
13
year
old
Sigismund
was
sent
to
Krak
w
by
his
eldest
half
brother
and
guardian
Wenceslaus
King
of
Germany
and
Bohemia
to
learn
Polish
and
to
become
acquainted
with
the
land
and
its
people
King
Wenceslaus
also
gave
him
Neumark
to
facilitate
communication
between
Brandenburg
and
Poland
The
disagreement
between
Polish
landlords
of
Lesser
Poland
on
one
side
and
landlords
of
Greater
Poland
on
the
other
regarding
the
choice
of
the
future
King
of
Poland
finally
ended
in
choosing
the
Lithuanian
side
the
support
of
the
lords
of
Greater
Poland
was
not
enough
to
give
Prince
Sigismund
the
Polish
crown
Instead
the
landlords
of
Lesser
Poland
gave
it
to
Mary

younger
sister

The
next
year
he
was
accepted
as
Mary
s
future
co
ruler
by
the
Treaty
of
Gy

However
Mary
was
captured
together
with
her
mother

had
acted

Having
raised
money
by
pledging
Brandenburg
to
his
cousin
Jobst
margrave
of
Moravia
1388
he
was
engaged
for
the
next
nine
years
in
a
ceaseless
struggle
for
the
possession
of
this
unstable
throne
The
central
power
was
finally
weakened
to
such
an
extent
that
only
Sigismund
s
alliance
with
the
powerful
Czillei
Garai
League
could
ensure
his
position
on
the
throne
3
It
was
not
for
entirely
selfless
reasons
that
one
of
the
leagues
of
barons
helped
him
to
power
Sigismund
had
to
pay
for
the
support
of
the
lords
by
transferring
a
sizable
part
of
the
royal
properties
For
some
years
the
baron
s
council
governed
the
country
in
the
name
of
the
Holy
Crown
The
restoration
of
the
authority
of
the
central
administration
took
decades
of
work
The
bulk
of
the
nation
headed
by
the
House
of
Garai
was
with
him
but
in
the
southern
provinces
between
the
Sava
and
the
Drava
the
Horvathys
with
the
support
of
King
Tvrtko
I
of
Bosnia
Mary
s
maternal
uncle
proclaimed
as
their
king
Ladislaus
king
of
Naples
son
of
the
murdered
Charles
II
of
Hungary
Not
until
1395
did
Nicholas
II
Garay
succeed
in
suppressing
them
Mary
died
heavily
pregnant
in
1395
To
ease
the
pressure
from
Hungarian
nobles
Sigismud
tried
to
employ
foreign
advisors
which
was
not
popular
and
he
had
to
promise
not
to
give
land
and
nominations
to
other
than
Hungarian
nobles
However
this
was
not
applied
to
Stibor
of
Stiboricz
who
was
Sigismund
s
closest
friend
and
advisor
On
a
number
of
occasions
Sigismund
was
imprisoned
by
nobles
but
with
help
of
the
armies
of
Garai
and
Stibor
of
Stiboricz
he
would
regain

In
1396
Sigismund
led
the
combined
armies
of
Christendom
against
the
Turks
who
had
taken
advantage
of
the
temporary
helplessness
of
Hungary
to
extend
their
dominion
to
the
banks
of
the
Danube
This
crusade
preached
by
Pope
Boniface
IX
was
very
popular
in
Hungary
The
nobles
flocked
in
the
thousands
to
the
royal
standard
and
were
reinforced
by
volunteers
from
nearly
every
part
of
Europe
the
most
important
contingent
being
that
of
the
French
led
by
John
the
Fearless
son
of
Philip
II
Duke
of
Burgundy
Sigismund
set
out
with
90
000
men
and
a
flotilla
of
70
galleys
After
capturing
Vidin
he
camped
with
his
Hungarian
armies
before
the
fortress
of
Nicopolis
Sultan
Bayezid
I
raised
the
siege
of
Constantinople
and
at
the
head
of
140
000
men
completely
defeated
the
Christian
forces
in
the
Battle
of
Nicopolis
fought
between
the
25
and
28
September
1396
Sigismund
returned
by
sea
and
through
the
realm
of
Zeta
where
he
ordained
a
local
Montenegrin
lord
ura
II
with
the
islands
of
Hvar
and
Kor
ula
for
resistance
against
the
Turks
the
islands
were
returned
to
Sigismund
after
Durad
s
death
in
April
1403
The
disaster
in
Nicopolis
angered
several
Hungarian
lords
leading
to
instability
in
the
kingdom
Deprived
of
his
authority
in
Hungary
Sigismund
then
turned
his
attention
to
securing
the
succession
in
Germany
and
Bohemia
and
was
recognized
by
his
childless
half
brother
Wenceslaus
IV
as
Vicar
General
of
the
whole
Empire
However
he
was
unable
to
support
Wenceslaus
when
he
was
deposed
in
1400
and
Rupert
of
Germany
Elector
Palatine
was
elected
German
king
in
his
stead

On
his
return
to
Hungary
in
1401
Sigismund
was
imprisoned
once
and
deposed
twice
In
1401
Sigismund
helped
an
uprising
against
Wenceslaus
during
the
course
of
which
the
Bohemian
king
was
taken
prisoner
and
Sigismund
ruled
Bohemia
for
nineteen
months
He
released
Wenceslaus
in
1403
In
the
meantime
a
group
of
Hungarian
noblemen
swore
loyalty
to
the
last
Anjou
monarch
Ladislaus
of
Naples
putting
their
hands
on
the
relic
of
Saint
Ladislas
of
Hungary
in
Nagyv
rad
Ladislaus
was
the
son
of
the
murdered
Charles
II
of
Hungary
and
thus
a
distant
relative
of
the
long
dead
King
Louis
I
of
Hungary
Ladislaus
captured
Zadar
in
1403
but
soon
stopped
any
military
advance
This
struggle
in
turn
led
to
a
war
with
the
Republic
of
Venice
as
Ladislaus
had
sold
the
Dalmatian
cities
to
the
Venetians
for
100
000
ducats
before
leaving
for
his
own
land
In
the
following
years
Sigismund
acted
indirectly
to
thwart
Ladislaus
attempts
to
conquer
central
Italy
by
allying
with
the
Italian
cities
resisting
him
and
by
applying
diplomatic
pressure
on
him
Due
to
his
frequent
absences
attending
to
business
in
the
other
countries
over
which
he
ruled
he
was
obliged
to
consult
Diets
in
Hungary
with
more
frequency
than
his
predecessors
and
institute
the
office
of
Palatine
as
chief
administrator
while
he
was
away

In
1404
Sigismund
introduced
the
Placetum
Regium
According
to
this
decree
Papal
bulls
could
not
be
pronounced
in
Hungary
without
the
consent
of
the
king
During
his
long
reign
the
royal
castle
of
Buda
became
probably
the
largest
Gothic
palace
of
the
late
Middle
Ages

Sigismund
managed
to
establish
control
in
Slavonia
He
did
not
hesitate
to
use
violent
methods
see
Bloody
Sabor
of
Kri
evci
but
from
the
river
Sava
to
the
south
his
control
was
weak
Sigismund
personally
led
an
army
of
almost
50
000
crusaders
against
the
Croats
and
Bosnians
culminating
with
the
Battle
of
Dobor
in
1408
a
massacre
of
about
200
noble
families
Order
of
the
Dragon
edit
Sigismund
founded
his
personal
order
of
knights
the
Order
of
the
Dragon
after
the
victory
at
Dobor
The
main
goal
of
the
order
was
fighting
the
Ottoman
Empire
Members
of
the
order
were
mostly
his
political
allies
and
supporters
The
main
members
of
the
order
were
Sigismund
s
close
allies
Nicholas

Garay
Hermann

encouraged
international
trade
by
abolishing
internal
duties
regulating
tariffs
on
foreign
goods
and
standardizing
weights
and
measures
throughout
the
country
King
of
the
Romans
edit
After
the
death
of
King
Rupert
of
Germany
in
1410
Sigismund
ignoring
the
claims
of
his
half
brother
Wenceslaus
was
elected
as
successor
by
three
of
the
electors
on
10
September
1410
but
he
was
opposed
by
his
cousin
Jobst
of
Moravia
who
had
been
elected
by
four
electors
in
a
different
election
on
1
October
Jobst
s
death
18
January
1411
removed
this
conflict
and
Sigismund
was
again
elected
king
on
21
July
1411
His
coronation
was
deferred
until
8
November
1414

it
took
place
at
Aachen
Anti
Polish
alliances
edit
On
a
number
of
occasions
and
in
1410
in
particular
Sigismund
allied
himself
with
the
Teutonic
Knights
against
W
adys
aw
II
of
Poland
In
return
for
300
000
ducats
he
would
attack
Poland
from
the
south
after
the
truce
on
St
John
s
Day
24
June
expired
Sigismund
ordered
his
most
loyal
friend
Stibor
of
Stiboricz
to
set
up
the
attack
on
Poland
Stibor
of
Stiboricz
was
of
Polish
origin
and
from
the
main
line
of
the
powerful
Clan
of
Ostoja
that
had
also
been
against
choosing
Jagiello
as
King
of
Poland
With
the
support
of
Sigismund
Stibor
become
one
of
the
most
influential
men
in
late
medieval
Europe
holding
titles
as
Duke
of
Transylvania
and
owning
about
25
of
modern
day
Slovakia
including
31
castles
of
which
15
were
situated
around
the
406
km
long
V
h
river
with
surrounding
land
that
was
given
to
him
by
Sigismund
In
the
diplomatic
struggle
to
prevent
war
between
Poland
Lithuania
which
was
supported
by
the
Muscovites
and
the
Teutonic
Knights
Sigismund
used
Stibor
s
fine
diplomacy
to
gain
financially
The
Polish
side
appointed
several
negotiators
and
most
of
them
were
also
from
the
Clan
of
Ostoja
distant
relations
of
the
Stibors
However
those
family
meetings
could
not
prevent
the
war
and
an
alliance
of
twenty
two
western
states
formed
an
army
against
Poland
in
the
Battle
of
Grunwald
in
July
1410
Stibor
attacked
then
Nowy
S
cz
and
burned
it
to
the
ground
but
after
that
he
returned
with
his
army
back
to
the
Beckov
Castle
After
the
Polish
Lithuanian
victory
in
the
Battle
of
Grunwald
the
Teutonic
knights
had
to
pay
a
huge
sum
of
silver
to
Poland
as
reparation
and
again
through
diplomacy
of
his
friend
Stibor
Sigismund
was
able
to
borrow
all
this
silver
from
King
W
adys
aw
II
of
Poland
on
good
conditions
In
the
light
of
facts
about
the
diplomatic
work
of
Stibor
and
the
Clan
of
Ostoja
that
was
following
the
politics
of
King
Sigismund
one
can
question
whether
Sigismund
actually
joined
the
anti
Polish
alliance
5
Council
of
Constance
edit
Sigismund
and
Barbara
of
Celje
at
the
Council
of
Constance
From
1412
to
1423
Sigismund
campaigned
against
the
Venetians
in
Italy
The
king
took
advantage
of
the
difficulties
of
Antipope
John
XXIII
to
obtain
a
promise
that
a
council
should
be
called
in
Constance
in
1414
to
settle
the
Western
Schism
He
took
a
leading
part
in
the
deliberations
of
this
assembly
and
during
the
sittings
made
a
journey
to
France
England
and
Burgundy
in
a
vain
attempt
to
secure
the
abdication
of
the
three
rival
popes
The
council
ended
in
1418
solving
the
Schism
and
of
great
consequence
to
Sigismund
s
future
career
having
the
Czech
religious
reformer
Jan
Hus
burned
at
the
stake
for
heresy
in
July
1415
The
complicity
of
Sigismund
in
the
death
of
Hus
is
a
matter
of
controversy
He
had
granted
him
a
safe
conduct
and
protested
against
his
imprisonment
and
the
reformer
was
burned
during
his
absence
It
was
also
at
this
Council
that
a
cardinal
ventured
to
correct
Sigismund
s
Latin
he
had
construed
the
word
schisma
as
feminine
rather
than
neuter
To
this
Sigismund
replied
in
Latin
I
am
king
of
the
Romans
and
above
grammar
6
This
utterance
prompted
historian
Thomas
Carlyle
to
give
him
the
nickname
Super
Grammaticam
from
the
response
that
he
had
given
Ego
sum
rex
Romanus
et
super
grammaticam
7

An
alliance
with
England
against
France
and
a
failed
attempt
owing
to
the
hostility
of
the
princes
to
secure
peace
in
Germany
by
a
league
of
the
towns
were
his
main
acts
during
these
years
Also
Sigismund
granted
control
of
the
Margraviate
of
Brandenburg
which
he
had
received
back
after
Jobst
s
death
to
Frederick
I
of
Hohenzollern
burgrave
of
Nuremberg
1415
This
step
made
the
Hohenzollern
family
one
of
the
most
important
in
Germany
Sigismund
began
to
shift
his
alliance
from
France
to
England
after
the
French
defeat
at
the
Battle
of
Agincourt
The
Treaty
of
Canterbury
August
15
1416
culminated
diplomatic
efforts
between
Henry
V
of
England
and
Sigismund
and
resulted
in
a
defensive
and
offensive
alliance
against
France
This
in
turn
led
the
way
to
the
resolution
of
the
papal
schism

Hussite
Wars
edit
Portrait
of
Emperor
Sigismund
painted
by
Albrecht
D
rer
after
the
emperor
s
death
In
1419
the
death
of
Wenceslaus
IV
left
Sigismund
titular
King
of
Bohemia
but
he
had
to
wait
for
seventeen
years
before
the
Czech
Estates
would
acknowledge
him
It
was
then
and
remained
till
much
later
in
question
whether
Bohemia
was
a
hereditary
or
an
elective
monarchy
especially
as
the
line
through
which
Sigismund
claimed
the
throne
had
accepted
that
the
Kingdom
of
Bohemia
was
an
elective
monarchy
elected
by
the
nobles
and
thus
the
regent
of
the
kingdom
en
k
of
Wartenberg
also
explicitly
stated
that
Sigismund
had
not
been
elected
as
reason
for
Sigismund
s
claim
to
not
be
accepted
Although
the
two
dignities
of
King
of
the
Romans
and
King
of
Bohemia
added
considerably
to
his
importance
and
indeed
made
him
the
nominal
temporal
head
of
Christendom
they
conferred
no
increase
of
power
and
financially
embarrassed
him
It
was
only
as
King
of
Hungary
that
he
had
succeeded
in
establishing
his
authority
and
in
doing
anything
for
the
order
and
good
government
of
the
land
Entrusting
the
government
of
Bohemia
to
Sofia
of
Bavaria
the
widow
of
Wenceslaus
he
hastened
into
Hungary
The
Bohemians
who
distrusted
him
as
the
betrayer
of
Hus
were
soon
in
arms
and
the
flame
was
fanned
when
Sigismund
declared
his
intention
of
prosecuting
the
war
against
heretics
Three
campaigns
against
the
Hussites
ended
in
disaster
although
the
army
of
his
most
loyal
ally
Stibor
of
Stiboricz
and
later
his
son
Stibor
of
Beckov
could
hold
the
Hussite
side
away
from
the
borders
of
the
Kingdom
The
Turks
were
again
attacking
Hungary
The
king
unable
to
obtain
support
from
the
German
princes
was
powerless
in
Bohemia
His
attempts
at
the
diet
of
Nuremberg
in
1422
to
raise
a
mercenary
army
were
foiled
by
the
resistance
of
the
towns
and
in
1424
the
electors
among
whom
was
Sigismund
s
former
ally
Frederick
I
of
Hohenzollern
sought
to
strengthen
their
own
authority
at
the
expense
of
the
king
Although
the
scheme
failed
the
danger
to
Germany
from
the
Hussites
led
to
the
Union
of
Bingen
which
virtually
deprived
Sigismund
of
the
leadership
of
the
war
and
the
headship
of
Germany
Final
years
edit
In
1428
Sigismund
led
another
campaign
against
the
Turks
but
again
with
few
results
In
1431
he
went
to
Milan
where
on
25
November
he
received
the
Iron
Crown
as
King
of
Italy
after
which
he
remained
for
some
time
at
Siena
negotiating
for
his
coronation
as
emperor
and
for
the
recognition
of
the
Council
of
Basel
by
Pope
Eugenius
IV
He
was
crowned
emperor
in
Rome
on
31
May
1433
and
after
obtaining
his
demands
from
the
Pope
returned
to
Bohemia
where
he
was
recognized
as
king
in
1436
though
his
power
was
little
more
than
nominal
Shortly
after
he
was
crowned
Pope
Eugenius
began
attempts
to
create
a
new
anti
Ottoman
alliance
10
This
was
sparked
citation
needed
by
an
Albanian
revolt
against
the
Ottomans
which
had
begun
in
1432
In
1435
Sigismund
sent
Fruzhin
a
Bulgarian
nobleman
to
negotiate
an
alliance
with
the
Albanians
He
also
sent
Daud
a
pretender
to
the
Ottoman
throne
in
early
1436
11
However
following
the
defeat
of
the
rebels
in
1436
plans
for
an
anti
Ottoman
alliance
ended
11
Sigismund
died
on
9
December
1437
at
Znojmo
German
Znaim
Moravia
now
Czech
Republic
and
as
ordered
in
life
he
was
buried
at
Nagyv
rad
Hungary
today
Oradea
Romania
next
to
the
tomb
of
the
king
Saint
Ladislaus
I
of
Hungary
who
was
the
ideal
of
the
perfect
monarch
warrior
and
Christian
for
that
time
and
was
deeply
venerated
by
Sigismund
12
By
his
second
wife
Barbara
of
Celje
he
left
an
only
daughter
Elisabeth
of
Luxembourg
who
was
married
to
Albert
V
duke
of
Austria
later
German
king
as
Albert
II
whom
Sigismund
named
as
his
successor
As
he
left
no
sons
his
line
of
the
House
of
Luxembourg
became
extinct
on
his
death
Family
and
issue
edit
Sigismund
married
twice
but
had
little
luck
in
securing
the
succession
to
his
crowns
Each
of
his
two
marriages
resulted
in
the
birth
of
one
child
His
first
born
child
probably
a
son
was
born
prematurely
as
a
result
of
a
horse
riding
accident
suffered
by
Queen
Mary
of
Hungary
when
she
was
well
advanced
in
pregnancy
Mother
and
child
both
died
shortly
after
the
birth
in
the
hills
of
Buda
on
17
May
1395
This
caused
a
deep
succession
crisis
because
Sigismund
ruled
over
Hungary
by
right
of
his
wife
and
although
he
managed
to
keep
his
power
the
crisis
lasted
until
his
second
marriage
to
Barbara
of
Celje
Barbara
s
only
child
born
in
the
purple
on
7
October
1409
probably
in
the
castle
of
Visegr
d
was
Elisabeth
of
Luxembourg
the
future
queen
consort
of
Hungary
Germany
and
Bohemia
Queen
Barbara
was
unable
to
give
birth
to
any
further
issue
Elisabeth
of
Bohemia
was
thus
the
only
surviving
legitimate
offspring
of
Sigismund
Hungarian
affiliations
edit
Coat
of
arms
of
John
Hunyadi
Sigismund
was
known
to
speak
fluent
Hungarian
wore
Hungarian
style
royal
clothes
and
even
grew
his
beard
in
the
Hungarian
fashion
13
He
also
spent
huge
amounts
of
money
during
his
reign
to
rebuild
the
Gothic
castles
of
Buda
and
Visegr
d
in
the
Kingdom
of
Hungary
ordering
the
transportation
of
materials
from
Austria
and
Bohemia
14
His
many
affairs
with
women
led
to
the
birth
of
several
legends
as
the
one
that
existed
decades
later
during
the
reign
of
the
King
Matthias
Corvinus
of
Hungary
According
to
this
John
Hunyadi
was
Sigismund
s
illegitimate
son
Sigismund
gave
a
ring
to
the
boy
s
mother
when
he
was
born
but
one
day
in
the
forest
a
raven
stole
it
from
her
and
the
ring
was
only
recovered
after
the
bird
was
hunted
down
It
is
said
that
this
incident
inspired
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
Hunyadis
and
later
also
appeared
in
the
coat
of
arms
of
Matthias
Corvinus
15
Sigismund
adopted
the
Hungarian
reverence
for
Saint
Ladislaus
I
of
Hungary
who
was
considered
to
be
an
ideal
Christian
knight
at
that
time
He
went
on
pilgrimage
several
times
to
his
tomb
in
Nagyv
rad
Before
Sigismund
died
he
ordered
to
be
buried
next
to
the
king
saint

The
remains
of
the
East
Tower
of
the
Porta
Praetoria
of
Roman
times
The
first
settlements
in
Regensburg
date
from
the
Stone
Age
The
Celtic
name
Radasbona
was
the
oldest
given
to
a
settlement
near
the
present
city
Around
AD
90
the
Romans
built
a
fort
there
In
179
a
new
Roman
fort
Castra
Regina
fortress
by
the
river
Regen
was
built
for
Legio
III
Italica
during
the
reign
of
Emperor
Marcus
Aurelius
3
It
was
an
important
camp
on
the
most
northerly
point
of
the
Danube
it
corresponds
to
what
is
today
the
core
of
Regensburg
s
Old
City
or
Altstadt
east
of
the
Obere
and
Untere
Bachgasse
and
West
of
the
Schwanenplatz
It
is
believed
that
as
early
as
in
late
Roman
times
the
city
was
the
seat
of
a
bishop
and
St
Boniface
re
established
the
Bishopric
of
Regensburg
in
739
From
the
early
6th
century
Regensburg
was
the
seat
of
a
ruling
family
known
as
the
Agilolfings
From
about
530
to
the
first
half
of
the
13th
century
it
was
the
capital
of
Bavaria
Regensburg
remained
an
important

who
condemned
the

After

Frankish
ruler
Louis

the
German
Two
years
later
fourteen
Bohemian
princes
came
to
Regensburg
to
receive
baptism
there
This
was
the
starting
point
of
Christianization
of
the
Czechs
and
the
diocese
of
Regensburg
became
the
mother
diocese
of
that
of
Prague
These
events
had
a
wide
impact
on
the
cultural
history
of
the
Czech
lands
as
they
were
consequently
part
of
the
Roman
Catholic
and
not
the
Slavic
Orthodox
world

in

Between

Bridge

This
bridge
opened
major
international
trade
routes
between

Europe
and
Venice
and
this
began
Regensburg
s
golden
age
as
a
residence

The

and
all
three
Imperial
Abbeys
were
mediatised
simultaneously
In
1245
Regensburg
became
a
Free
Imperial
City
and
was
a
trade
centre
before
the
shifting
of
trade
routes
in
the
late
Middle
Ages
At
the
end
of
the
15th
century
in
1486
Regensburg
became
part
of
the
Duchy
of
Bavaria
but
its
independence
was
restored
by
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
ten
years
later
The
city
adopted
the
Protestant
Reformation
in
1542
and
its
Town
Council
remained
entirely
Lutheran
From
1663
to
1806
the
city
was
the
permanent
seat
of
the
Imperial
Diet
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
which
became
known
as
the
Perpetual
Diet
of
Regensburg
Thus
Regensburg
was
one
of
the
central
towns
of
the
Empire
attracting
visitors
in
large
numbers
Ceremonial
arrival
at
the
Imperial
Diet
1711
A
minority
of
the
population
remained
Roman
Catholic
and
Roman
Catholics
were
denied
civil
rights
B
rgerrecht
But
the
town
of
Regensburg
must
not
be
confused
with
the
Bishopric
of
Regensburg
Although
the
Imperial
city
had
adopted
the
Reformation
the
town
remained
the
seat
of
a
Roman
Catholic
bishop
and
several
abbeys
Three
of
the
latter
St
Emmeram
Niederm
nster
and
Oberm
nster
were
estates
of
their
own
within
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
meaning
that
they
were
granted
a
seat
and
a
vote
at
the
Imperial
Diet
Reichstag
So
there
was
the
unique
situation
that
the
town
of
Regensburg
comprised
five
independent
states
in
terms
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
the
Protestant
city
itself
the
Roman
Catholic
bishopric
and
the
three
monasteries
mentioned
previously
In

it
was

as
the
traditional
capital
of
the
region

Modern
history
edit
In
1803
the
city
lost
its
status
as
a
free
city
following
its
incorporation
into
the
Principality
of
Regensburg
It
was
handed
over
to
the
Archbishop
of
Mainz
and
Archchancellor
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
Carl
von
Dalberg
in
compensation
for
Mainz
which
had
become
French
under
the
terms
of
the
Treaty
of
Lun

in
1801
The
archbishopric
of
Mainz
was

Dalberg
strictly
modernized

Most
importantly
he
awarded
equal
rights
to
Protestants
and
Roman
Catholics
alike
In
1810
Dalberg
ceded
Regensburg
to
the
Kingdom
of
Bavaria
he
himself
being
compensated
by
the
award
of
Fulda
and
Hanau
to
him
under
the
title
of
Grand
Duke
of
Frankfurt
Between
April
19
and
April
23
1809
Regensburg
was
the
scene
of
the
Battle
of
Ratisbon
between
forces
commanded
by
Henri
Gatien
Bertrand
and
Napoleon
himself
and
the
retreating
Austrian
forces
The
city
was
eventually
overrun
after
supplies
and
ammunition
ran
out
The
city
suffered
severe
damage
during
the
fight
with
about
150
houses
being
burnt
and
others
being
looted
Nazism

edit
Regensburg
was
home
to
both
a
Messerschmitt

factory
and
an
oil
refinery
which
were
bombed
by
the
Allies
on

by

Schweinfurt
Regensburg
mission
and
on
February

1945
during

Oil
Campaign
of

War
II
Although
both
targets
were
badly
damaged
Regensburg
itself
suffered
little
damage
from
the
Allied
strategic
bombing
campaign
and
the
nearly
intact
medieval
city
centre
is
listed
as
a
UNESCO
World
Heritage
Site
The
city
s
most
important
cultural
loss
was
that
of
the
Romanesque
church
of
Oberm
nster
which
was
destroyed
in
a
March
1945
air
raid
and
was
not
rebuilt
the
belfry
survived
Also
Regensburg
s
slow
economic
recovery
after
the
war
ensured
that
historic
buildings
were
not
torn
down
to
be
replaced
by
newer
ones
When
the
upswing
in
restoration
reached
Regensburg
in
the
late
1960s
the
prevailing
mindset
had
turned
in
favour
of
preserving
the
city

heritage

Other
names
of
Vienna
The
English
name
Vienna
is
borrowed
from
the
homonymous
Italian
version
of
the
city
s
name
or
the
French
Vienne
The
etymology
of
the
city
s
name
is
still
subject
to
scholarly
dispute
Some
claim
that
the
name
comes
from
Vedunia
meaning
forest
stream
which
subsequently
produced
the
Old
High
German
Uuenia
Wenia
in
modern
writing
the
New
High
German
Wien
and
its
dialectal
variant
Wean
42
Others
believe
that
the
name
comes
from
the
Roman
settlement
name
of
Celtic
extraction
Vindobona
probably
meaning
fair
village
white
settlement
from
Celtic
roots
vindo
meaning
bright
or
fair
as
in
the
Irish
fionn
and
the
Welsh
gwyn
and
bona
village
settlement
43
The
Celtic
word
Vindos
may
reflect
a
widespread
prehistorical
cult
of
Vindos
a
Celtic
God
A
variant
of
this
Celtic
name
could
be
preserved
in
the
Czech
Slovak
and
Polish
names
of
the
city
V
de
Viede
and
Wiede
respectively
and
in
that
of
the
city
s
district

The
name
of
the
city
in
Hungarian
B
cs
Serbo
Croatian

and
Ottoman
Turkish

has
a
different
probably
Slavonic
origin
and

Allied
occupied
Austria
After
the
war
Vienna
was
part
of
Soviet
occupied
Eastern
Austria
until
September
1945
As
in
Berlin
Vienna
in
September
1945
was
divided
into
sectors
by
the
four
powers
the
US
the
UK
France
and
the
Soviet
Union
and
supervised
by
an
Allied
Commission
The
four
power
occupation
of
Vienna
differed
in
one
key
respect
from
that
of
Berlin
the
central
area
of
the
city
known
as
the
first
district
constituted
an
international
zone
in
which
the
four
powers
alternated
control
on
a
monthly
basis
The
control
was
policed
by
the
four
powers
on
a
de
facto
day
to
day
basis

The
Berlin
Blockade
of
1948
raised
Western
concerns
that
the
Soviets
might
repeat
the
blockade
in
Vienna
The
matter
was
raised
in
the
UK
House
of
Commons
What
plans
have
the
Government
for
dealing
with
a
similar
situation
in
Vienna
Vienna
is
in
exactly
a
similar
position
to
Berlin
It
is
surrounded
by
a
Soviet
Zone
of
occupation
and
we
have
our
sector
of
responsibility
in
Vienna
the
same
as
the
Americans
and
the
French
What
plans
have
the
Government
to
deal
with
a
similar
situation
arising
in
Vienna
in
the
near
future
I
hope
we
shall
have
an
answer
because
this
is
of
vital
importance

Nutting

There
was
a
lack
of
airfields
in
the
Western
sectors
and
authorities
drafted
contingency
plans
to
deal
with
such
a
blockade
Plans
included
the
laying
down
of
metal
landing
mats
at
Sch
nbrunn
The
Soviets
did
not
blockade
the
city
The
Potsdam
Agreement
included
written
rights
of
land
access
to
the
western
sectors
whereas
no
such
written
guarantees
had
covered
the
western
sectors
of
Berlin
During
the
10
years
of
the
four
power
occupation
Vienna
became
a
hot
bed
for
international
espionage
between
the
Western
and
Eastern
blocs
In
the
wake
of
the
Berlin
Blockade
the
Cold
War
in
Vienna
took
on
a
different
dynamic
While
accepting
that
Germany
and
Berlin
would
be
divided
the
Soviets
had
decided
against
allowing
the
same
state
of
affairs
to
arise
in
Austria
and
Vienna
Here
the
Soviet
forces
controlled
districts
2
4
10
20
21
and
22
and
all
areas
incorporated
into
Vienna
in
1938
They
put
up
barbed
wire
fences
around
the
perimeter
of
West
Berlin
in
1953
but
not
in
Vienna
By
1955
the
Soviets
by
signing
the
Austrian
State
Treaty
agreed
to
relinquish
their
occupation
zones
in
Eastern
Austria
as
well
as
their
sector
in
Vienna
In
exchange
they
required
that
Austria
declare
its
permanent
neutrality
after
the
allied
powers
had
left
the
country
Thus
they
ensured
that
Austria
would
not
be
a
member
of
NATO
and
that
NATO
forces
would
therefore
not
have
direct
communications
between
Italy
and
West
Germany
The
atmosphere
of
four
power
Vienna
is
the
background
for
Graham
Greene
s
screenplay
for
the
film
The
Third
Man
1949
Later
he
adapted
the
screenplay
as
a
novel
and
published
it
Occupied
Vienna
is
also
depicted
in
the
Philip
Kerr
novel
A
German
Requiem
Austrian
State
Treaty
and
afterwards
edit
The
four
power
control
of
Vienna
lasted
until
the
Austrian
State
Treaty
was
signed
in
May
1955
That
year
after
years
of
reconstruction
and
restoration
the
State
Opera
and
the
Burgtheater
both
on
the
Ringstra
e
reopened
to
the
public
The
Soviet
Union
signed
the
State
Treaty
only
after
having
been
provided
with
the
political
guarantee
by
the
federal
government
to
declare
Austria
s
neutrality
after
the
withdrawal
of
the
allied
troops
This
law
of
neutrality
passed
in
late
October
1955
and
not
the
State
Treaty
itself
ensured
that
modern
Austria
would
align
with
neither
NATO
nor
the
Soviet
bloc
and
is
considered
one
of
the
reasons
for
Austria
s
late
entry
into
the
European
Union
In
the
1970s
Austrian
Chancellor
Bruno
Kreisky
inaugurated
the
Vienna
International
Centre
a
new
area
of
the
city
created
to
host
international
institutions
Vienna
has
regained
much
of
its
former
international
stature
by
hosting
international
organizations
such
as
the
United
Nations
United

Industrial
Development

Because
of
the
industrialization
and
migration

Empire
the
population
of
Vienna
increased
sharply
during

Vienna
was
the
city

55
After

many
Czechs
and
Hungarians
returned
to
their
ancestral
countries
resulting
in
a
decline
in
the
Viennese
population
After

used
force
to
repatriate
key
workers
of
Czech
Slovak

to
return
to

The

s
Innere
Stadt
was
a
fortress
surrounded
by
fields
in
order
to
defend
itself
from
potential
attackers
In
1850
Vienna
with
the
consent
of
the
emperor
annexed

with
the
separation
of
Margareten
from

no

Consequently
the
walls
were
razed
after
1857
66
making
it
possible
for
the
city
centre
to
expand
In
their
place
a
broad
boulevard
called
the
Ringstra
e
was
built
along
which
imposing
public
and
private
buildings
monuments
and
parks
were
created
by
the
start
of
the
20th
century
These
buildings
include
the
Rathaus
town
hall
the
Burgtheater
the
University
the
Parliament
the
twin
museums
of
natural
history
and
fine

and
the

Outside

In

In
the
twenty
years
before
the
First
World
War
and
until
1918
Viennese
politics
were
shaped
by
the
Christian
Social
Party
in
particular
long
term
mayor
Karl
Lueger
he
was
able
to
not
apply
the
general
voting
rights
for
men
introduced
by
and
for
the
parliament
of
imperial
Austria
the
Reichsrat
in
1907
thereby
excluding
most
of
the
working
class
from
taking
part
in
decisions
For
Adolf
Hitler
who
spent
some
years
in
Vienna
Lueger
was
a
remarkable
teacher
of
how
to
use
antisemitism
in
politics
Vienna
is
today
considered
the
center
of
the
Social
Democratic
Party
During
the
period
of
the
First
Republic
1918
1934
the
Vienna
Social
Democrats
undertook
many
social
reforms
At
that
time
Vienna
s
municipal
policy
was
admired
by
Socialists
throughout
Europe
who
therefore
referred
to
the
city
as
Red
Vienna
Rotes
Wien
In
February
1934
troops
of
the
Austrian
federal
government
under
Engelbert
Dollfuss
who
had
closed
down
the
first
chamber
of
the
federal
parliament
the
Nationalrat
in
1933
and
paramilitary
socialist
organisations
were
engaged
in
the
Austrian
Civil
War
which
led
to
the
ban
of
the
Social
Democratic
party
For
most
of
the
time
since
after
the
First
World
War
the
city
has
been
governed
by
the
Social
Democratic
Party
SP
with
absolute
majorities
in
the
city
parliament
Only
between
1934
and
1945
when
the
Social
Democratic
Party
was
illegal
mayors
were
appointed
by
the
austro
fascist
and
later
by
the
Nazi
authorities
The
current
mayor
of
Vienna
is
Michael
H
upl
of
the
SP
As
rural
Austria
is
dominated
by
conservative
citizens
if
the
Social
Democrats
would
not
maintain
their
nearly
unbreakable
hold
on
Vienna
the
rival
Austrian
People
s
Party
VP
would
dominate
Austrian
politics
The
city
has
enacted
many
social
democratic
policies
The
Gemeindebauten
are
social
housing
assets
that
are
well
integrated
into
the
city
architecture
outside
the
first
or
inner
district
The
low
rents
enable
comfortable
accommodation
and
good
access
to
the
city
amenities
Many
of
the
projects
were
built
after
the
Second
World
War
on
vacant
lots
that
were
destroyed
by
bombing
during
the
war
The
city
took
particular
pride
in
building
them
to
a
high
standard

Kirche
de
in
Vienna
is
remarkable
for
its
innovative
use
of
poured

concrete
as
both
structure

also
for
its

Concurrent
to

movement
was
the
Wiener

during

some

shunned

period
was
Adolf

Viennese
caf
s
edit
Demel
Caf
Viennese
caf
s
have
an
extremely
long
and
distinguished
history
that
dates
back
centuries
and
the
caffeine
addictions
of
some
famous
historical
patrons
of
the
oldest
are
something
of
a
local
legend
These
coffee
houses
are
unique
to
Vienna
and
many
cities
have
unsuccessfully
sought
to
copy
them
Some
people
consider
caf
s
as
their
extended
living
room
where
nobody
will
be
bothered
if
they
spend
hours
reading
a
newspaper
while
enjoying
their
coffee
Traditionally
the
coffee
comes
with
a
glass
of
water
Viennese
caf
s
claim
to
have
invented
the
process
of
filtering
coffee
from
booty
captured
after
the
second
Turkish
siege
in
1683
Viennese
caf
s
claim
that
when
the
invading
Turks
left
Vienna
they
abandoned
hundreds
of
sacks
of
coffee
beans
The
Polish
King
John
III
Sobieski
the
commander
of
the
anti
Turkish
coalition
of
Poles
Germans
and
Austrians
gave
Franz
George
Kolschitzky
Polish
Franciszek
Jerzy
Kulczycki
some
of
this
coffee
as
a
reward
for
providing
information
that
allowed
him
to
defeat
the
Turks
Kolschitzky
then
opened
Vienna
s
first
coffee
shop
Julius
Meinl
set
up
a
modern
roasting
plant
in
the
same
premises
where
the
coffee
sacks
were
found
in
1891

A
guild
ld
is
an
association
of
artisans
or
merchants
who
oversee
the
practice
of
their
craft
in
a
particular
town
The
earliest
types
of
guild
were
formed
as
confraternities
of
tradesmen
They
were
organized
in
a
manner
something
between
a
professional
association
trade
union
a
cartel
and
a
secret
society
They
often
depended
on
grants
of
letters
patent
by
a
monarch
or
other
authority
to
enforce
the
flow
of
trade
to
their
self
employed
members
and
to
retain
ownership
of
tools
and
the
supply
of
materials
A
lasting
legacy
of
traditional
guilds
are
the
guildhalls
constructed
and
used
as
meeting
places
One
of
the
legacies
of
the
guilds
the
elevated
Windsor
Guildhall
was
originally
a
meeting
place
for
guilds
as
well
as
magistrates
seat
and
town
hall
An
important
result
of
the
guild
framework
was
the
emergence
of
universities
at
Bologna
established
in
1088
Oxford
at
least
since
1096
and
Paris
c
1150
they
originated
as
guilds
of
students
as
at
Bologna
or
of
masters
as
at
Paris

History
of
guilds
edit
Early
guild
like
associations
edit
A
type
of
guild
was
known
in
Roman
times
Known
as
collegium
collegia
or
corpus
these
were
organised
groups
of
merchants
who
specialised
in
a
particular
craft
and
whose
membership
of
the
group
was
voluntary
One
such
example
is
the
corpus
naviculariorum
the
college
of
long
distance
shippers
based
at
Rome
s
La
Ostia
port
The
Roman
guilds
failed
to
survive
the
collapse
of
the
Roman
Empire
2
In
medieval
cities
craftsmen
tended
to
form
associations
based
on
their
trades
confraternities
of
textile
workers
masons
carpenters
carvers
glass
workers
each
of
whom
controlled
secrets
of
traditionally
imparted
technology
the
arts
or
mysteries
of
their
crafts
Usually
the
founders
were
free
independent
master
craftsmen
who
hired
apprentices

These
signs
can
be
found
in
many
old
European
towns
where
guild
members
marked
their
places
of
business
Many
survived
through
time
or
staged
a
comeback
in
industrial
times
Today
they
are
restored
or
even
newly
created
especially
in
old
town
areas

Medieval
guild
edit
There
were
several
types
of
guilds
including
the
two
main
categories
of
merchant
guilds
and
craft
guilds
4
but
also
the
frith
guild
and
religious
guild
5
The
continental
system
of
guilds
and
merchants
arrived
in
England
after
the
Norman
Conquest
with
incorporated
societies
of
merchants
in
each
town
or
city
holding
exclusive
rights
of
doing
business
there
In
many
cases
they
became
the
governing
body
of
a
town
For
example
London
s
Guildhall
became
the
seat
of
the
Court
of
Common
Council
of
the
City
of
London
Corporation
the
world
s
oldest
continuously
elected
local
government

whose
members
to
this
day
must
be
Freemen
of
the
City
7
The
Freedom
of
the
City
effective
from
the
Middle
Ages
until
1835
gave
the
right
to
trade
and
was
only
bestowed
upon
members
of
a
Guild
or
Livery
8
Trade
guilds
arose
in
the
14th
century
as
craftsmen
united
to
protect
their
common
interest
Early
egalitarian
communities
called
guilds
for
the
gold
deposited
in
their
common
funds
were
denounced
by
Catholic
clergy
for
their
conjurations
the
binding
oaths
sworn
among
the
members
to
support
one
another
in
adversity
kill
specific
enemies
and
back
one
another
in
feuds
or
in
business
ventures
The
occasion
for
these
oaths
were
drunken
banquets
held
on
December
26
the
pagan
feast
of
Jul
Yule
in
858
West
Francian
Bishop
Hincmar
sought
vainly
to
Christianise
the
guilds
9
In
the
Early
Middle
Ages
most
of
the
Roman
craft
organisations
originally
formed
as
religious
confraternities
had
disappeared
with
the
apparent
exceptions
of
stonecutters
and
perhaps
glassmakers
mostly
the
people
that
had
local
skills
Gregory
of
Tours
tells
a
miraculous
tale
of
a
builder
whose
art
and
techniques
suddenly
left
him
but
were
restored
by
an
apparition
of
the
Virgin
Mary
in
a
dream

the
story
speaks

the
importance
of

In
France
guilds
were
called
corps
de
m
tiers
According
to
Viktor
Ivanovich
Rutenburg
Within
the
guild
itself
there
was
very
little
division
of
labour
which
tended
to
operate
rather
between
the
guilds
Thus
according
to
tienne
Boileau
s
Book
of
Handicrafts
by
the
mid
13th
century
there
were
no
less
than
100
guilds
in
Paris
a
figure
which
by
the
14th
century
had
risen
to
350
11
There
were
different
guilds
of
metal
workers
the
farriers
knife
makers
locksmiths
chain
forgers
nail
makers
often
formed
separate
and
distinct
corporations
the
armourers
were
divided
into
helmet
makers
escutcheon
makers
harness
makers
harness
polishers
etc

at
Barcelona
guilds

In

more

The

reached
a
mature
state
in

circa
1300
and
held
on
in
German
cities
into
the
19th
century
with
some
special
privileges
for
certain
occupations
remaining

guilds
to
develop
in
Western
Europe
were
the
gremios
of
Spain
e
g
Valencia

or
Toledo
1426
Not
all
city
economies
were
controlled
by
guilds
some
cities
were
free
Where
guilds
were
in
control
they
shaped
labor
production
and
trade
they
had
strong
controls
over
instructional
capital
and
the
modern
concepts
of
a
lifetime
progression
of
apprentice
to
craftsman
and
then
from
journeyman
eventually
to
widely
recognized
master
and
grandmaster
began
to
emerge
In
order
to
become
a
Master
a
Journeyman
would
have
to
go
on
a
three
year
voyage
called
Journeyman
years
The
practice
of
the
Journeyman
years
still
exists
in
Germany
and
France
As
production
became
more
specialized
trade
guilds
were
divided
and
subdivided
eliciting
the
squabbles
over
jurisdiction
that
produced
the
paperwork
by
which
economic
historians
trace
their
development
The
metalworking
guilds
of
Nuremberg
were
divided
among
dozens
of
independent
trades
in
the
boom
economy
of
the
13th
century
and
there
were
101
trades
in
Paris
by
1260
17
In
Ghent
as
in
Florence
the
woolen
textile
industry
developed
as
a
congeries
of
specialized
guilds
The
appearance
of
the
European
guilds
was
tied
to
the
emergent
money
economy
and
to
urbanization
Before
this
time
it
was
not
possible
to
run
a
money
driven
organization
as
commodity
money
was
the
normal
way
of
doing
business

The
guild
was
at
the
center
of
European
handicraft
organization
into
the
16th
century
In
France
a
resurgence
of
the
guilds
in
the
second
half
of
the
17th
century
is
symptomatic
of
the
monarchy
s
concerns
to
impose
unity
control
production
and
reap
the
benefits
of
transparent
structure
in
the
shape
of
more
efficient
taxation
citation
needed
The
guilds
were
identified
with
organizations
enjoying
certain
privileges
letters
patent
usually
issued
by
the
king
or
state
and
overseen
by
local
town
business
authorities
some
kind
of
chamber
of
commerce
These
were
the
predecessors
of
the
modern
patent
and
trademark
system
The
guilds
also
maintained
funds
in
order
to
support
infirm
or
elderly
members
as
well
as
widows
and
orphans
of
guild
members
funeral
benefits
and
a
tramping
allowance
for
those
needing
to
travel
to
find
work
As
the
guild
system
of
the
City
of
London
declined
during
the
17th
century
the
Livery
Companies
transformed
into
mutual
assistance
fraternities
along
such
lines
European
guilds
imposed
long
standardized
periods
of
apprenticeship
and
made
it
difficult
for
those
lacking
the
capital
to
set
up
for
themselves
or
without
the
approval
of
their
peers
to
gain
access
to
materials
or
knowledge
or
to
sell
into
certain
markets
an
area
that
equally
dominated
the
guilds
concerns
These
are
defining
characteristics
of
mercantilism
in
economics
which
dominated
most
European
thinking
about
political
economy
until
the
rise
of
classical
economics
The
guild
system
survived
the
emergence
of
early
capitalists
which
began
to
divide
guild
members
into
haves
and
dependent
have
nots
The
civil
struggles
that
characterize
the
14th
century
towns
and
cities
were
struggles
in
part
between
the
greater
guilds
and
the
lesser
artisanal
guilds
which
depended
on
piecework
In
Florence
they
were
openly
distinguished
the
Arti
maggiori
and
the
Arti
minori
already
there
was
a
popolo
grasso
and
a
popolo
magro
18
Fiercer
struggles
were
those
between
essentially
conservative
guilds
and
the
merchant
class
which
increasingly
came
to
control
the
means
of
production
and
the
capital
that
could
be
ventured
in
expansive
schemes
often
under
the
rules
of
guilds
of
their
own
German
social
historians
trace
the
Zunftrevolution
the
urban
revolution
of
guildmembers
against
a
controlling
urban
patriciate
sometimes
reading
into
them
however
perceived
foretastes
of
the
class
struggles
of
the
19th
century
Locksmith
1451
In
the
countryside
where
guild
rules
did
not
operate
there
was
freedom
for
the
entrepreneur
with
capital
to
organize
cottage
industry
a
network
of
cottagers
who
spun
and
wove
in
their
own
premises
on
his
account
provided
with
their
raw
materials
perhaps
even
their
looms
by
the
capitalist
who
took
a
share
of
the
profits
Such
a
dispersed
system
could
not
so
easily
be
controlled
where
there
was
a
vigorous
local
market
for
the
raw
materials
wool
was
easily
available
in
sheep
rearing
regions
whereas
silk
was
not
Organization
edit
In
Florence
Italy
there
were
seven
to
12
greater
guilds
and
14
lesser
guilds
the
most
important
of
the
greater
guilds
was
that
for
judges
and
notaries
who
handled
the
legal
business
of
all
the
other
guilds
and
often
served
as
an
arbitrator
of
disputes
Other
greater
guilds
include
the
wool
silk
and
the
money
changers
guilds
They
prided
themselves
on
a
reputation
for
very
high
quality
work
which
was
rewarded
with
premium
prices
The
guilds
fined
members
who
deviated
from
standards
Other
greater
guilds
included
those
of
doctors
druggists
and
furriers
Among
the
lesser
guilds
were
those
for
bakers
saddle
makers
ironworkers
and
other
artisans
They
had
a
sizable
membership
but
lacked
the
political
and
social
standing
necessary
to
influence
city
affairs
19
The
guild
was
made
up
by
experienced
and
confirmed
experts
in
their
field
of
handicraft
They
were
called
master
craftsmen
Before
a
new
employee
could
rise
to
the
level
of
mastery
he
had
to
go
through
a
schooling
period
during
which
he
was
first
called
an
apprentice
After
this
period
he
could
rise
to
the
level
of
journeyman
Apprentices
would
typically
not
learn
more
than
the
most
basic
techniques
until
they
were
trusted
by
their
peers
to
keep
the
guild
s
or
company
s
secrets
Like
journey
the
distance
that
could
be
travelled
in
a
day
the
title
journeyman
derives
from
the
French
words
for
day
jour
and
journ
e
from
which
came
the
middle
English
word
journei
Journeymen
were
able
to
work
for
other
masters
unlike
apprentices
and
generally
paid
by
the
day
and
were
thus
day
labourers
After
being
employed
by
a
master
for
several
years
and
after
producing
a
qualifying
piece
of
work
the
apprentice
was
granted
the
rank
of
journeyman
and
was
given
documents
letters
or
certificates
from
his
master
and
or
the
guild
itself
which
certified
him
as
a
journeyman
and
entitled
him
to
travel
to
other
towns
and
countries
to
learn
the
art
from
other
masters
These
journeys
could
span
large
parts
of
Europe
and
were
an
unofficial
way
of
communicating
new
methods
and
techniques
though
by
no
means
all
journeymen
made
such
travels
they
were
most
common
in
Germany
and
Italy
and
in
other
countries
journeymen
from
small
cities
would
often
visit
the
capital

be
received
as
master
craftsman
though
in
some
guilds
this
step
could
be
made
straight
from
apprentice
This
would
typically
require
the
approval
of
all
masters
of
a
guild
a
donation
of
money
and
other
goods
often
omitted
for
sons
of
existing
members
and
the
production
of
a
so
called
masterpiece
which
would
illustrate
the
abilities
of
the
aspiring
master
craftsman
this
was
often
retained
by
the
guild
21
The
medieval
guild
was
established
by
charters
or
letters
patent
or
similar
authority
by
the
city
or
the
ruler
and
normally
held
a
monopoly
on
trade
in
its
craft
within
the
city
in
which
it
operated
handicraft
workers
were
forbidden
by
law
to
run
any
business
if
they
were
not
members
of
a
guild
and
only
masters
were
allowed
to
be
members
of
a
guild
Before
these
privileges
were
legislated
these
groups
of
handicraft
workers
were
simply
called
handicraft
associations
The
town
authorities
might
be
represented
in
the
guild
meetings
and
thus
had
a
means
of
controlling
the
handicraft
activities
This
was
important
since
towns
very
often
depended
on
a
good
reputation
for
export
of
a
narrow
range
of
products
on
which
not
only
the
guild
s
but
the
town
s
reputation
depended

etc
helped
to
establish
a
town
s
place
in
global
commerce
this
led
to
modern
trademarks
In
many
German
and
Italian
cities
the
more
powerful
guilds
often
had
considerable
political
influence
and
sometimes
attempted
to
control
the
city
authorities
In
the
14th
century
this
led
to
numerous
bloody
uprisings
during
which
the
guilds
dissolved
town
councils
and
detained
patricians
in
an
attempt
to
increase
their
influence
In
fourteenth
century
north
east
Germany
people
of
Wendish
i
e
Slavic
origin
were
not
allowed
to
join
some
guilds

Fall

guilds

meeting
rooms
c
1820
As
Ogilvie
2004
shows
the
guilds
negatively
affected
quality
skills
and
innovation
Through
what
economists
now
call
rent
seeking
they
imposed
deadweight
losses
on
the
economy
Ogilvie
says
they
generated
no
demonstrable
positive
externalities
and
notes
that
industry
began
to
flourish
only
after
the
guilds
faded
away
Guilds
persisted
over
the
centuries
because
they
redistributed
resources
to
politically
powerful
merchants
On
the
other
hand
Ogilvie
agrees
guilds
created
social
capital
of
shared
norms
common
information
mutual
sanctions
and
collective
political
action
This
social
capital
benefited
guild
members
even
as
it
hurt
outsiders
24
The
guild
system
became
a
target
of
much
criticism
towards
the
end
of
the
18th
century
and
the
beginning
of
the
19th
century
They
were
believed
to
oppose
free
trade
and
hinder
technological
innovation
technology
transfer
and
business
development
According
to
several
accounts
of
this
time
guilds
became
increasingly
involved
in
simple
territorial
struggles
against
each
other
and
against
free
practitioners
of
their
arts
Two
of
the
most
outspoken
critics
of
the
guild
system
were
Jean
Jacques
Rousseau
and
Adam
Smith
and
all
over
Europe
a
tendency
to
oppose
government
control
over
trades
in
favour
of
laissez
faire
free
market
systems
was
growing
rapidly
and
making
its
way
into
the
political
and
legal
system
The
French
Revolution
saw
guilds
as
a
last
remnant
of
feudalism
The
Le
Chapelier
Law
of
1791
abolished
the
guilds
in
France
25
Smith
wrote
in
The
Wealth
of
Nations
Book
I
Chapter
X
paragraph
72
It
is
to
prevent
this
reduction
of
price
and
consequently
of
wages
and
profit
by
restraining
that
free
competition
which
would
most
certainly
occasion
it
that
all
corporations
and
the
greater
part
of
corporation
laws
have
been
established
and
when
any
particular
class
of
artificers
or
traders
thought
proper
to
act
as
a
corporation
without
a
charter
such
adulterine
guilds
as
they
were
called
were
not
always
disfranchised
upon
that
account
but
obliged
to
fine
annually
to
the
king
for
permission
to
exercise
their
usurped
privileges
Karl
Marx
in
his
Communist
Manifesto
also
criticized
the
guild
system
for
its
rigid
gradation
of
social
rank
and
the
relation
of
oppressor
oppressed
entailed
by
this
system
From
this
time
comes
the
low
regard
in
which
some
people
hold
the
guilds
to
this
day
In
part
due
to
their
own
inability
to
control
unruly
corporate
behavior
the
tide
turned
against
the
guilds
Because
of
industrialization
and
modernization
of
the
trade
and
industry
and
the
rise
of
powerful
nation
states
that
could
directly
issue
patent
and
copyright
protections
often
revealing
the
trade
secrets
the
guilds
power
faded
After
the
French
Revolution
they
fell
in
most
European
nations
through
the
19th
century
as
the
guild
system
was
disbanded
and
replaced
by
free
trade
laws
By
that
time
many
former
handicraft
workers
had
been
forced
to
seek
employment
in
the
emerging
manufacturing
industries
using
not
closely
guarded
techniques
but
standardized
methods
controlled
by
corporations

Guilds
are
sometimes
said
to
be
the
precursors
of
modern
trade
unions
Guilds
however
can
also
be
seen
as
a
set
of
self
employed
skilled
craftsmen
with
ownership
and
control
over
the
materials
and
tools
they
needed
to
produce
their
goods
Guilds
were
more
like
cartels
than
they
were
like
trade
unions
Olson
1982
However
the
journeymen
organizations
which
were
at
the
time
illegal
26
may
have
been
influential
The
exclusive
privilege
of
a
guild
to
produce
certain
goods
or
provide
certain
services
was
similar
in
spirit
and
character
with
the
original
patent
systems
that
surfaced
in
England
in
1624
These
systems
played
a
role
in
ending
the
guilds
dominance
as
trade
secret
methods
were
superseded
by
modern
firms
directly
revealing
their
techniques
and
counting
on
the
state
to
enforce
their
legal
monopoly
Some
guild
traditions
still
remain
in
a
few
handicrafts
in
Europe
especially
among
shoemakers
and
barbers
Some
ritual
traditions
of
the
guilds
were
conserved
in
order
organisations
such
as
the
Freemasons
allegedly
deriving
from
the
Masons
Guild
and
the
Oddfellows
allegedly
derived
from
various
smaller
guilds
These
are
however
not
very
important
economically
except
as
reminders
of
the
responsibilities
of
some
trades
toward
the
public
Modern
antitrust
law
could
be
said
to
derive
in
some
ways
from
the
original
statutes
by
which
the
guilds
were
abolished
in
Europe
Economic
consequences
edit
The
economic
consequences
of
guilds
have
led
to
heated
debates
among
economic
historians
On
the
one
side
scholars
say
that
since
merchant
guilds
persisted
over
long
periods
they
must
have
been
efficient
institutions
since
inefficient
institutions
die
out
Others
say
they
persisted
not
because
they
benefited
the
entire
economy
but
because
they
benefited
the
owners
who
used
political
power
to
protect
them
Ogilvie
2011
says
they
regulated
trade
for
their
own
benefit
were
monopolies
distorted
markets
fixed
prices
and
restricted
entrance
into
the
guild
20
Ogilvie
2008
argues
that
their
long
apprenticeships
were
unnecessary
to
acquire
skills
and
their
conservatism
reduced
the
rate
of
innovation
and
made
the
society
poorer
She
says
their
main
goal
was
rent
seeking
that
is
to
shift
money
to
the
membership
at
the
expense
of
the
entire
economy
27
Epstein
and
Prak
s
book
2008
rejects
Ogilvie
s
conclusions
28
Specifically
Epstein
argues
that
guilds
were
cost
sharing
rather
than
rent
seeking
institutions
They
located
and
matched
masters
and
likely
apprentices
through
monitored
learning
Whereas
the
acquisition
of
craft
skills
required
experience
based
learning
he
argues
that
this
process
necessitated
many
years
in
apprenticeship
29
The
extent
to
which
guilds
were
able
to
monopolize
markets
is
also
debated

a
cognitive
basis
of
any
kind
had
to
be
at
least
approximately
defined
before
the
rising
modern
professions
could
negotiate
cognitive
exclusiveness
that
is
before
they
could
convincingly
establish
a
teaching
monopoly
on
their
specific
tools
and
techniques
while
claiming
absolute
superiority
for
them
The
proved
institutional
mechanisms
for
this
negotiation
were
the
license
the
qualifying
examination
the
diploma
and
formal
training
in
a
common
curriculum
The
typical
institutions
that
administered
these
devices
were
first
the
guild
like
professional
association
and
later
the
professional
school
which
superseded
the
association
in
effectiveness
Obviously
none
of
this
was
in
itself
an
organizational
invention
The
guilds
of
merchants
that
sprang
up
in
eleventh
century
Europe
were
also
voluntary
associations
tending
towards
the
monopolistic
control
of
a
new

Biography
edit
Frederick
was
born
in
Nuremberg
the
second
born
son
of
Burgrave
Frederick
V
1333
1398
and
the
Wettin
princess
Elisabeth
of
Meissen
He
entered
early
into
the
service
of
his
brother
in
law
the
Habsburg
duke
Albert
III
of
Austria
After
Albert
s
death
in
1395
he
fought
on
the
side
of
the
Luxembourg
king
Sigismund
of
Hungary
against
invading
Ottoman
forces
He
and
his
elder
brother
John
husband
of
Sigismund
s
sister
Margaret
of
Bohemia
fought
in
the
1396
Battle
of
Nicopolis
where
they
suffered
a
disastrous
defeat
After
Frederick
returned
to
Nuremberg
he
divided
the
Franconian
inheritance
from
his
father
with
his
brother
John
who
received
the
Principality
of
Bayreuth
while
Frederick
kept
the
Principality
of
Ansbach
the
brothers
ruled
jointly
in
the
Burgraviate
of
Nuremberg
At
first
Frederick
tried
to
mediate
in
the
imperial
confusion
between
Sigismund
s
elder
half
brother
the
German
king
Wenceslaus
and
the
party
of
Elector
Rupert
III
of
the
Palatinate
but
from
September
1399
he
fought
on
the
side
of
Rupert
husband
of
his
sister
Elizabeth
nonetheless
Wenceslaus
was
eventually
deposed
and
Rupert
elected
King
of
the
Romans
on
21
August
1400
Frederick
resumed
his
rule
of
Ansbach
in
1409
and
after
heavy
feuding
entered
into
the
service
of
King
Sigismund
In
1410
the
death
of
Rupert
King
of
the
Germans
left
the
throne
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
vacant
Sigismund
enlisted
Frederick
s
help
in
obtaining
the
throne
At
the
time
Jobst
of
Moravia
ruled
Brandenburg
and
thus
was
one
of
the
prince
electors
who
had
the
right
to
vote
for
the
new
king
However
Sigismund
disputed
Jobst
s
claim
to
Brandenburg
and
his
right
to
vote
in
the
imperial
election
Sigismund
claimed
these
rights
for
himself
and
designated
Frederick
to
represent
him
as
elector
of
Brandenburg
in
the
imperial
election
of
20
September
1410
While
Sigismund
won
this
initial
vote
Jobst
of
Moravia
won
the
support
of
a
majority
of
electors
in
an
election
in
October
1410
and
himself
claimed
the
imperial
throne
Jobst
s
death
under
suspicious
circumstances
in
January
1411
cleared
the
way
for
Sigismund
s
recovery
of
Brandenburg
and
his
undisputed
election
as
king
of
the
empire
later
that
year
In
gratitude
for
Frederick
s
services
King
Sigismund
made
him
Oberster
Hauptmann
and
Verwalter
der
Marken
1411
With
an
iron
hand
Frederick
fought
against
the
rebellious
nobility
of
the
March
of
Brandenburg
in
particular
the
Quitzow
family
and
in
the
end
restored
security
Frederick
also
became
a
member
of
the
Parakeet
Society
and
of
the
League
of
Constance
At
the
Council
of
Constance
30
April
1415
Sigismund
granted
Frederick
the
titles
of
Margrave
and
Prince
elector
of
Brandenburg
On
21
October
1415
the
Brandenburg
states
meeting
in
a
Landtag
asked
him
to
rule
in
Berlin
The
king
awarded
him
the
formal
enfeoffment
of
the
margravate
on
18
April
1417
As
Frederick
did
not
agree
with
the
forcible
action
of
Sigismund
against
the
Hussites
relations
between
them
cooled
Constant
feuding
with
the
nobility
of
Brandenburg
led
Frederick
to
withdraw
to
his
castle
at
Cadolzburg
in
1425
and
transfer
the
regency
of
the
margravate
to
his
son
John
in
1426
Frederick
however
remained
elector
After
1427
he
organized
the
imperial
war
against
the
Hussites
and
subsequently
provided
substantial
assistance
in
the
mediation
of
the
Compacta
of
Prague
at
the
Council
of
Basel
30
November
1433
Upon
his
death
in

This
article
lists
the
Margraves
and
Electors
of
Brandenburg
during
the
period
of
time
that
Brandenburg
was
a
constituent
state
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
The
Mark
or
March
of
Brandenburg
was
one
of
the
primary
constituent
states
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
It
was
created
in
1157
as
the
Margraviate
of
Brandenburg
by
Albert
the
Bear
Margrave
of
the
Northern
March
In
1356
by
the
terms
of
the
Golden
Bull
of
Charles
IV
the
Margrave
of
Brandenburg
was
given
the
permanent
right
to
participate
in
the
election
of
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
with
the
title
of
Elector
German
Kurf
rst
The
early
rulers
came
from
several
different
dynasties
but
from
1415
Brandenburg
and
its
successor
states
were
ruled
by
the
House
of
Hohenzollern
for
over
500
years
From
1618
onward
Brandenburg
was
ruled
in
personal
union
with
the
Duchy
of
Prussia
The
Hohenzollerns
raised
Prussia
to
a
kingdom
as
the
Kingdom
of
Prussia
in
1701
and
from
then
on
Brandenburg
was
de
facto
treated
as
part
of
the
kingdom
even
though
it
was
legally
still
part
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
The
titles
of
Margrave
of
Brandenburg
and
Elector
of
Brandenburg
were
abolished
along
with
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
in
1806
although
they
were
one
of
the
titles
of
the
Kings
of
Prussia
until
1918
and
Brandenburg
was
formally
integrated
into
Prussia
From
1871
to
1918
the
Hohenzollerns
were
also
the
German
Emperors

The
Hussite
Wars
also
called
the
Bohemian
Wars
or
the
Hussite
Revolution
were
fought
between
the
pre
Reformation
movement
of
Hussites
and
various
European
monarchs
loyal
to
the
Papacy
who
sought
to
enforce
the
authority
of
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
various
Hussite
factions
also
confronted
each
other
especially
the
Utraquists
who
opposed
remaining
Hussite
spinoffs
alongside
Roman
Catholics
These
wars
lasted
from
1419
to
approximately
1434
The
Hussite
community
included
most
of
the
Czech
population
of
the
Kingdom
of
Bohemia
and
formed
a
major
military
power
They
defeated
five
crusades
proclaimed
against
them
by
the
Pope
1420
1421
1422
1427
and
in
1431
and
intervened
in
the
wars
of
neighboring
countries
The
Hussite
Wars
were
notable
for
the
extensive
use
of
early
hand
held
firearms
such
as
hand
cannons
The
fighting
ended
after
1434
when
the
moderate
Utraquist
faction
of
the
Hussites
defeated
the
radical
Taborite
faction
The
Hussites
agreed
to
submit
to
the
authority
of
the
King
of
Bohemia
and
the
Church
and
were
allowed
to
practice
their
somewhat
variant

Church
and
the
Papacy
and
he
promoted
the
reformist
ideas
of
English
theologian
John
Wycliffe
His
preaching
was
widely
heeded
in
Bohemia
and
provoked
suppression
by
the
Church
which
had
declared
Wycliffe
a
heretic
In
1411
in
the
course
of
the
Western
Schism
Antipope
John
XXIII
proclaimed
a
crusade
against
King
Ladislaus
of
Naples
the
protector
of
rival
Pope
Gregory
XII
To
raise
money
for
this
he
proclaimed
indulgences
in
Bohemia
Hus
bitterly
denounced
this
and
explicitly
quoted
Wycliffe
against
it
provoking
further
complaints
of
heresy
but
winning
much
support
in
Bohemia
In
1414
Sigismund
of
Hungary
convened
the
Council
of
Constance
to
end
the
Schism
and
resolve
other
religious
controversies
Hus
went
to
the
Council
under
a
safe
conduct
from
Sigismund
but
was
imprisoned
tried
and
executed
on
6
July
1415
The
knights
and
nobles
of
Bohemia
and
Moravia
who
were
in
favour
of
church
reform
sent
the
protestatio
Bohemorum
to
the
Council
of
Constance
on
2
September
1415
which
condemned
the
execution
of
Hus
in
the
strongest
language
This
angered
Sigismund
who
was
King
of
the
Romans
head
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
though
not
yet
Emperor
and
brother
of
King
Wenceslaus
of
Bohemia
He
had
been
persuaded
by
the
Council
that
Hus
was
a
heretic
He
sent
threatening
letters
to
Bohemia
declaring
that
he
would
shortly
drown
all
Wycliffites
and
Hussites
greatly
incensing
the
people
Disorder
broke
out
in
various
parts
of
Bohemia
and
drove
many
Catholic
priests
from
their
parishes
Almost
from
the
beginning
the
Hussites
divided
into
two
main
groups
though
many
minor
divisions
also
arose
among
them
Shortly
before
his
death
Hus
had
accepted
the
doctrine
of
Utraquism
preached
during
his
absence
by
his
adherents
at
Prague
the
obligation
of
the
faithful
to
receive
communion
in
both
kinds
bread
and
wine
sub
utraque
specie
This
doctrine
became
the
watchword
of
the
moderate
Hussites
known
as
the
Utraquists
or
Calixtines
from
the
Latin
calix
the
chalice
in
Czech
kali
n
ci
from
kalich
The
more
extreme
Hussites
became
known
as
Taborites
t
borit
after
the
city
of
T
bor
that
became
their
center
or
Orphans
sirotci
a
name
they
adopted
after
the
death
of
their
leader
and
general
Jan
i
ka
Under
the
influence
of
Sigismund
Wenceslaus
endeavoured
to
stem
the
Hussite
movement
A
number
of
Hussites
led
by
Mikul
of
Hus
no
relation
of
Jan
Hus
left
Prague
They
held
meetings
in
various
parts
of
Bohemia
particularly
at
Sezimovo
st
not
to
be
confused
with
st
nad
Labem
near
the
spot
where
the
town
of
T
bor
was
founded
soon
afterwards
At
these
meetings
they
violently
denounced
Sigismund
and
the
people
everywhere
prepared
for
war
In
spite
of
the
departure
of
many
prominent
Hussites
the
troubles
at
Prague
continued
On
30
July
1419
Hussite
procession
headed
by
the
priest
Jan
elivsk
attacked
New
Town
Hall
in
Prague
and
threw
the
king
s
representatives
the
burgomaster
and
some
town
councillors
from
the
windows
into
the
street
the
first
Defenestration
of
Prague
where
several
were
killed
by
the
fall
after
a
rock
was
allegedly
thrown
from
the
town
hall
and
hit
elivsk
2
It
has
been
suggested
that
Wenceslaus
was
so
stunned
by
the
defenestration
that
it
caused
his
death
on
16
August
1419

Alternatively
it
is
possible
that
he
may
have
just
died
of
natural
causes

The
outbreak
of
fighting
edit
The
death
of
Wenceslaus
resulted
in
renewed
troubles
in
Prague
and
in
almost
all
parts
of
Bohemia
Many
Catholics
mostly
Germans
mostly
still
faithful
to
the
Pope
were
expelled
from
the
Bohemian
cities
Wenceslaus
widow
Sophia
of
Bavaria
acting
as
regent
in
Bohemia
hurriedly
collected
a
force
of
mercenaries
and
tried
to
gain
control
of
Prague
which
led
to
severe
fighting
After
a
considerable
part
of
the
city
had
been
damaged
or
destroyed
the
parties
declared
a
truce
on
13
November
The
nobles
sympathetic
to
the
Hussite
cause
but
supporting
the
regent
promised
to
act
as
mediators
with
Sigismund
while
the
citizens
of
Prague
consented
to
restore
to
the
royal
forces
the
castle
of
Vy
ehrad
which
had
fallen
into
their
hands
i
ka
who
disapproved
of
this
compromise
left
Prague
and
retired
to
Plze
Unable
to
maintain
himself
there
he
marched
to
southern
Bohemia
He
defeated
the
Catholics
at
the
Battle
of
Sudom
25
March
1420
the
first
pitched
battle
of
the
Hussite
wars
After
Sudom
he
moved
to
st
one
of
the
earliest
meeting
places
of
the
Hussites
Not
considering
its
situation
sufficiently
strong
he
moved
to
the
neighboring
new
settlement
of
the
Hussites
called
by
the
biblical
name
of
T
bor
T
bor
soon
became
the
center
of
the
most
militant
Hussites
who
differed
from
the
Utraquists
by
recognizing
only
two
sacraments
Baptism
and
Communion
and
by
rejecting
most
of
the
ceremony
of
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
The
ecclesiastical
organization
of
Tabor
had
a
somewhat
puritanical
character
and
the
government
was
established
on
a
thoroughly
democratic
basis
Four
captains
of
the
people
hejtman
were
elected
one
of
whom
was
i
ka
and
a
very
strict
military
discipline
was
instituted

Wagenburg
The
Hussite
Wagenburg
Depending
on
the
terrain
Hussites
prepared
carts
for
the
battle
forming
them
into
squares
or
circles
The
carts
were
joined
wheel
to
wheel
by
chains
and
positioned
aslant
with
their
corners
attached
to
each
other
so
that
horses
could
be
harnessed
to
them
quickly
if
necessary
In
front
of
this
wall
of
carts
a
ditch
was
dug
by
camp
followers
The
crew
of
each
cart
consisted
of
16
22
soldiers
4
8
crossbowmen
2
handgunners
6
8
soldiers
equipped
with
pikes
or
flails
the
flail
was
the
Hussite
national
weapon
2
shield
carriers
and
2
drivers
The
Hussites
battle
consisted
of
two
stages
the
first
defensive
the
second
an
offensive
counterattack
In
the
first
stage
the
army
placed
the
carts
near
the
enemy
army
and
by
means
of
artillery
fire
provoked
the
enemy
into
battle
The
artillery
would
usually
inflict
heavy
casualties
at
close
range
In
order
to
avoid
more
losses
the
enemy
knights
finally
attacked
Then
the
infantry
hidden
behind
the
carts
used
firearms
and
crossbows
to
ward
off
the
attack
weakening
the
enemy
The
shooters
aimed
first
at
the
horses
depriving
the
cavalry
of
its
main
advantage
Many
of
the
knights
died
as
their
horses
were
shot
and
they
fell
As
soon
as
the
enemy
s
morale
was
lowered
the
second
stage
an
offensive
counterattack
began
The
infantry
and
the
cavalry
burst
out
from
behind
the
carts
striking
violently
at
the
enemy
mostly
from
the
flanks
While
fighting
on
the
flanks
and
being
shot
at
from
the
carts
the
enemy
was
not
able
to
put
up
much
resistance
They
were
forced
to
withdraw
leaving
behind
dismounted
knights
in
heavy
armor
who
were
unable
to
escape
the
battlefield
The
enemy
armies
suffered
heavy
losses
and
the
Hussites
soon
had
the
reputation
of
not
taking
captives
The
first

crusade
edit
Battle
of
V
tkov
Hill
After
the
death
of
his
childless
brother
Wenceslaus
Sigismund
inherited
a
claim
on
the
Bohemian
crown
though
it
was
then
and
remained
till
much
later
in
question
whether
Bohemia
was
a
hereditary
or
an
elective
monarchy
especially
as
the
line
through
which
Sigismund
claimed
the
throne
had
accepted
that
the
Kingdom
of
Bohemia
was
an
elective
monarchy
elected
by
the
nobles
and
thus
the
regent
of
the
kingdom
en
k
of
Wartenberg
also
explicitly
stated
that
Sigismund
had
not
been
elected
as
reason
for
Sigismund
s
claim
to
not
be
accepted
A
firm
adherent
of
the
Church
of
Rome
Sigismund
was
aided
by
Pope
Martin
V
who
issued
a
bull
on
17
March
1420
proclaiming
a
crusade
for
the
destruction
of
the
Wycliffites
Hussites
and
all
other
heretics
in
Bohemia
Sigismund
and
many
German
princes
arrived
before
Prague
on
30
June
at
the
head
of
a
vast
army
of
crusaders
from
all
parts
of
Europe
largely
consisting
of
adventurers
attracted
by
the
hope
of
pillage
They
immediately
began
a
siege
of
the
city
which
had
however
soon
to
be
abandoned
Negotiations
took
place
for
a
settlement
of
the
religious
differences
The
united
Hussites
formulated
their
demands
in
a
statement
known
as
the
Four
Articles
of
Prague
This
document
the
most
important
of
the
Hussite
period
ran
in
the
wording
of
the
contemporary
chronicler
Laurence
of
Brezova
as
follows
1
The
word
of
God
shall
be
preached
and
made
known
in
the
kingdom
of
Bohemia
freely
and
in
an
orderly
manner
by
the
priests
of
the
Lord
2
The
sacrament
of
the
most
Holy
Eucharist
shall
be
freely
administered
in
the
two
kinds
that
is
bread
and
wine
to
all
the
faithful
in
Christ
who
are
not
precluded
by
mortal
sin
according
to
the
word
and
disposition
of
Our
Saviour
3
The
secular
power
over
riches
and
worldly
goods
which
the
clergy
possesses
in
contradiction
to
Christ
s
precept
to
the
prejudice
of
its
office
and
to
the
detriment
of
the
secular
arm
shall
be
taken
and
withdrawn
from
it
and
the
clergy
itself
shall
be
brought
back
to
the
evangelical
rule
and
an
apostolic
life
such
as
that
which
Christ
and
his
apostles
led
4
All
mortal
sins
and
in
particular
all
public
and
other
disorders
which
are
contrary
to
God
s
law
shall
in
every
rank
of
life
be
duly
and
judiciously
prohibited
and
destroyed
by
those
whose
office
it
is
citation
needed
These
articles
which
contain
the
essence
of
the
Hussite
doctrine
were
rejected
by
King
Sigismund
mainly
through
the
influence
of
the
papal
legates
who
considered
them
prejudicial
to
the
authority
of
the
Pope
Hostilities
therefore
continued
However
Sigismund
was
defeated
at
the
Battle
of
V
tkov
Hill
on
July
1420
Though
Sigismund
had
retired
from
Prague
his
troops

castles

Sigismund

edit
Bohemia
was
for
a
time
free
from
foreign
intervention
but
internal
discord
again
broke
out
caused
partly
by
theological
strife
and
partly
by
the
ambition
of
agitators
On
9
March
1422
Jan

was
arrested
by
the

beheaded

The
Hussites
were
aided
at

times
by

Because

to
be
offered
to
King
W

Jagie

The

offered
to

cousin
Vytautas
the
Grand
Duke
of

Vytautas
accepted
it
with
the
condition
that
the
Hussites
reunite
with
the
Catholic
Church
In

accepted
Prince
Sigismund
Korybut
of
Lithuania
nephew
of
W

as
regent
of
Bohemia
for

His
authority
was
recognized
by
the
Utraquist
nobles
the
citizens
of
Prague
and
the
more
moderate
of
the
Taborites
but
he
failed
to
bring
the
Hussites
back
into
the
Church
On
a
few
occasions
he
even
fought
against
both
the
Taborites
and
the
Orebites
to
try
to
force
them
into
reuniting
After
W

signed
the
Treaty
of

fourth
anti
Hussite
Crusade
edit
In
1426
the
Hussites
were
again
attacked
by
foreign
enemies
In
June
1426
Hussite
forces
led
by
Prokop
and
Sigismund
Korybut
signally
defeated
the
invaders
in
the
Battle
of
Aussig
Despite
this
result
the
death
of
Jan
i
ka
caused
many
including
Pope
Martin
V
to
believe
that
the
Hussites
were
much
weakened
Martin
proclaimed
yet
another
crusade
in
1427
He
appointed
Cardinal
Henry
Beaufort
of
England
as
Papal
Legate
of
Germany
Hungary
and
Bohemia
to
lead
the
crusader
forces
The
crusaders
were
defeated
at
the
Battle
of

The
Hussites
subsequently
invaded
parts
of
Germany
several
times
though
they
made
no
attempt
to
occupy
permanently
any
part
of
the
country
Korybut
was
imprisoned
in
1427
for
allegedly
conspiring
to
surrender
the
Hussite
forces
to
Sigismund

Hungary
He
was
released
in

participated
in

years
Korybut
returned

Poles
however
did
not

want

the
Pope
threatened
to
call

against
Poland
if

Beautiful

During
the
Hussite
Wars
the
Hussites
launched
raids
against
many
bordering
countries
The
Hussites
called
them
Spanil
j
zdy
beautiful
rides
Especially
under
the
leadership
of
Prokop
the
Great
Hussites
invaded
Silesia
Saxony
Hungary
Lusatia
and
Meissen
These
raids
were
against
countries
that
had
supplied
the
Germans
with
men
during
the
anti
Hussite
crusades
to
deter
further
participation
However
the
raids
did
not
have
the
desired
effect
these
countries
kept
supplying
soldiers
for
the
crusades
against
the
Hussites
During
a
war
between
Poland
and
the
Teutonic
Order
some
Hussite
troops
helped
the
Poles
In
1433
a
Hussite
army
of
7
000
men
marched
through
Neumark
into
Prussia
and
captured
Dirschau
on
the
Vistula
River
They
eventually
reached
the
mouth
of
the
Vistula
where
it
enters
the
Baltic
Sea
near
Danzig
There
they
performed
a
great
victory
celebration
to
show
that
nothing
but
the
ocean
could
stop
the
Hussites
The
Prussian
historian
Heinrich
von
Treitschke
later
wrote
that
they
had
greeted
the
sea
with
a
wild
Czech
song
about
God
s
warriors
and
filled
their
water
bottles
with
brine
in
token
that
the
Baltic
once
more
obeyed
the
Slavs
4
Peace
talks
edit
The
almost
uninterrupted
series
of
victories
of
the
Hussites
now
rendered
vain
all
hope
of
subduing
them
by
force
of
arms
Moreover
the
conspicuously
democratic
character
of
the
Hussite
movement
caused
the
German
princes
who
were
afraid
that
such
ideas
might
spread
to
their
own
countries
to
desire
peace
Many
Hussites
particularly
the
Utraquist
clergy
were
also
in
favour
of
peace
Negotiations
for
this
purpose
were
to
take
place
at
the
ecumenical
Council
of
Basel
which
had
been
summoned
to
meet
on
3
March
1431
The
Roman
See
reluctantly
consented
to
the
presence
of
heretics
at
this
council
but
indignantly
rejected
the
suggestion
of
the
Hussites
that
members
of
the
Eastern
Orthodox
Church
and
representatives
of
all
Christian
creeds
should
also
be
present
Before
definitely
giving
its
consent
to
peace
negotiations
the
Roman
Church
determined
on
making
a
last
effort
to
reduce
the
Hussites
to
subjection
this
resulted
in
the
fifth
Crusade
against
the
Hussites
The
fifth
anti
Hussite
crusade

Battle
of
Doma

15th
century
Jena
Codex
On
1
August
1431
a
large
army
of
crusaders
under
Frederick
I
Elector
of
Brandenburg
accompanied
by
Cardinal
Cesarini
as
papal
legate
crossed
the
Bohemian
border
On
8
August
the
crusaders
reached
the
city
of
Doma
lice
and
began
besieging
it
On
14
August
a
Hussite
relief
army
arrived
reinforced
with
some
6
000
Polish
Hussites
and
under
the
command
of
Prokop
the
Great
and
it
completely
routed
the
crusaders
at
the
resulting
Battle
of
Doma

New
negotiations
and
the
defeat
of
radical
Hussites
edit
On
15
October
1431
the
Council
of
Basel
issued
a
formal
invitation
to
the
Hussites
to
take
part
in
its
deliberations
Prolonged
negotiations
ensued
but
finally
a
Hussite
embassy
led
by
Prokop
and
including
John
of
Rokycan
the
Taborite
bishop
Nicolas
of
Pelh
imov
the
English
Hussite
Peter
Payne
and
many
others
arrived
at
Basel
on
4
January
1433
No
agreement
could
be
reached
but
negotiations
were
not
broken
off
and
a
change
in
the
political
situation
of
Bohemia
finally
resulted
in
a
settlement

the
Taborite
army
led
by
Prokop
the
Great
and
Prokop
the
Lesser
who
both
fell
in
the
battle
was
totally
defeated
and
almost
annihilated
at
the
Battle
of

The
Polish
Hussite
movement
also
came
to
an
end

of

defeated
the
Hussites
at
the
Battle

bringing
the
Hussite
Wars
to
an
end
Peace
agreement
edit
The
moderate
party
thus
obtained
the
upper
hand
and
wanted
to
find
a
compromise
between
the
council
and
the
Hussites
It
formulated
its
demands
in
a
document
which
was
finally
accepted
by
the
Church
of
Rome
in
a
slightly
modified
form
and
which
is
known
as
the
compacts
The
compacts
mainly
founded
on
the
articles
of
Prague
declare
that
The
Holy
Sacrament
is
to
be
given
freely
in
both
kinds
to
all
Christians
in
Bohemia
and
Moravia
and
to
those
elsewhere
who
adhere
to
the
faith
of
these
two
countries
All
mortal
sins
shall
be
punished
and
extirpated
by
those
whose
office
it
is
so
to
do
The
word
of
God
is
to
be
freely
and
truthfully
preached
by
the
priests
of
the
Lord
and
by
worthy
deacons
The
priests
in
the
time
of
the
law
of
grace
shall
claim
no
ownership
of
worldly
possessions
On
5
July
1436
the
compacts
were
formally
accepted
and
signed
at
Jihlava
Iglau
in
Moravia
by
King
Sigismund
by
the
Hussite
delegates
and
by
the
representatives
of
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
The
last
named
however
refused
to
recognize
as
archbishop
of
Prague
John
of
Rokycan
who
had
been
elected
to
that
dignity
by
the
estates
of
Bohemia

The

Wenzenbach
between

Emperor
Maximilian
I
and
the
Czech
Utraquists
in
1504
The
Utraquist
creed
frequently
varying
in
its
details
continued
to
be
that
of
the
established
church
of
Bohemia
until
all
non
Catholic
religious
services
were
prohibited
shortly
after
the
Battle
of
the
White
Mountain
in
1620
The
Taborite
party
never
recovered
from
its
defeat
at
Lipany
and
after
the
town
of
T
bor
had
been
captured
by
George
of
Pod
brady
in
1452
Utraquist
religious
worship
was
established
there
The
Bohemian
Brethren
Unitas
Fratrum
whose
intellectual
originator
was
Petr
Chel
ick
but
whose
actual
founders
were
Brother
Gregory
a
nephew
of
Archbishop
Rokycany
and
Michael
curate
of
amberk
to
a
certain
extent
continued
the
Taborite
traditions
and
in
the
15th
and
16th
centuries
included
most
of
the
strongest
opponents
of
Rome
in
Bohemia
J
A
Komensk
Comenius
a
member
of
the
Brethren
claimed
for
the
members
of
his
church
that
they
were
the
genuine
inheritors
of
the
doctrines
of
Hus
After
the
beginning
of
the
German
Reformation
many
Utraquists
adopted
to
a
large
extent
the
doctrines
of
Martin
Luther
and
of
John
Calvin
and
in
1567
obtained
the
repeal
of
the
Compacts
which
no
longer
seemed
sufficiently
far
reaching
From
the
end
of
the
16th
century
the
inheritors
of
the
Hussite
tradition
in
Bohemia
were
included
in
the
more
general
name
of
Protestants
borne
by
the
adherents
of
the
Reformation
At
the
end
of
the
Hussite
Wars
in
1431
the
lands
of
Bohemia
had
been
totally
ravaged
The
adjacent
Bishopric
of
W
rzburg
in
Germany
was
left
in
such
bad
shape
after
the
Hussite
Wars
that
the
impoverishment
of
the
people
was
still
evident
in
1476
The
poor
conditions
contributed
directly
to
the
peasant
conspiracy
that
broke
out
that
same
year
in
W
rzburg

Computer
science
deals
with
the
theoretical
foundations
of
information
and
computation
together
with
practical
techniques
for
the
implementation
and
application
of
these
foundations
Computer
science
is
the
study
of
the
theory
experimentation
and
engineering
that
form
the
basis
for
the
design
and
use
of
computers
It
is
the
scientific
and
practical
approach
to
computation
and
its
applications
and
the
systematic
study
of
the
feasibility
structure
expression
and
mechanization
of
the
methodical
procedures
or
algorithms
that
underlie
the
acquisition
representation
processing
storage
communication
of
and
access
to
information
An
alternate
more
succinct
definition
of
computer
science
is
the
study
of
automating
algorithmic
processes
that
scale
A
computer
scientist
specializes
in
the
theory
of
computation
and
the
design
of
computational
systems
1
Its
fields
can
be
divided
into
a
variety
of
theoretical
and
practical
disciplines
Some
fields
such
as
computational
complexity
theory
which
explores
the
fundamental
properties
of
computational
and
intractable
problems
are
highly
abstract
while
fields
such
as
computer
graphics
emphasize
real
world
visual
applications
Other
fields
still
focus
on
challenges
in
implementing
computation
For
example
programming
language
theory
considers
various
approaches
to
the
description
of
computation
while
the
study
of
computer
programming
itself
investigates
various
aspects
of
the
use
of
programming
language
and
complex
systems
Human
computer
interaction
considers
the
challenges
in
making
computers
and
computations
useful
usable
and
universally
accessible
to
humans

Charles
Babbage
is
sometimes
referred
as
father
of
computing

Ada
Lovelace
is
credited
with
writing
the
first
algorithm
intended
for
processing
on
a
computer

The
earliest
foundations
of
what
would
become
computer
science
predate
the
invention
of
the
modern
digital
computer
Machines
for
calculating
fixed
numerical
tasks
such
as
the
abacus
have
existed
since
antiquity
aiding
in
computations
such
as
multiplication
and
division
Further
algorithms
for
performing
computations
have
existed
since
antiquity
even
before
the
development
of
sophisticated
computing
equipment
Wilhelm
Schickard
designed
and
constructed
the
first
working
mechanical
calculator
in
1623
4
In
1673
Gottfried
Leibniz
demonstrated
a
digital
mechanical
calculator
called
the
Stepped
Reckoner
5
He
may
be
considered
the
first
computer
scientist
and
information
theorist
for
among
other
reasons
documenting
the
binary
number
system
In
1820
Thomas
de
Colmar
launched
the
mechanical
calculator
industry
note

when
he
released
his
simplified
arithmometer
which
was
the
first
calculating
machine
strong
enough
and
reliable
enough
to
be
used
daily
in
an
office
environment
Charles
Babbage
started
the
design
of
the
first
automatic
mechanical
calculator
his
Difference
Engine
in
1822
which
eventually
gave
him
the
idea
of
the
first
programmable
mechanical
calculator
his
Analytical
Engine
6
He
started
developing
this
machine
in
1834
and
in
less
than
two
years
he
had
sketched
out
many
of
the
salient
features
of
the
modern
computer
7
A
crucial
step
was
the
adoption
of
a
punched
card
system
derived
from
the
Jacquard
loom
7
making
it
infinitely
programmable
note
2
In
1843
during
the
translation
of
a
French
article
on
the
Analytical
Engine
Ada
Lovelace
wrote
in
one
of
the
many
notes
she
included
an
algorithm
to
compute
the
Bernoulli
numbers
which
is
considered
to
be
the
first
computer
program
8
Around
1885
Herman
Hollerith
invented
the
tabulator
which
used
punched
cards
to
process
statistical
information
eventually
his
company
became
part
of
IBM
In
1937
one
hundred
years
after
Babbage
s
impossible
dream
Howard
Aiken
convinced
IBM
which
was
making
all
kinds
of
punched
card
equipment
and
was
also
in
the
calculator
business
9
to
develop
his
giant
programmable
calculator
the
ASCC
Harvard
Mark
I
based
on
Babbage
s
Analytical
Engine
which
itself
used
cards
and
a
central
computing
unit
When
the
machine
was
finished
some
hailed
it
as
Babbage
s
dream
come
true
10
During
the
1940s
as
new
and
more
powerful
computing
machines
were
developed
the
term
computer
came
to
refer
to
the
machines
rather
than
their
human
predecessors
11
As
it
became
clear
that
computers
could
be
used
for
more
than
just
mathematical
calculations
the
field
of
computer
science
broadened
to
study
computation
in
general
Computer
science
began
to
be
established
as
a
distinct
academic
discipline
in
the
1950s
and
early
1960s
12
13
The
world
s
first
computer
science
degree
program
the
Cambridge
Diploma
in
Computer
Science
began
at
the
University
of
Cambridge
Computer
Laboratory
in
1953
The
first
computer
science
degree
program
in
the
United
States
was
formed
at
Purdue
University
in
1962
14
Since
practical
computers
became
available
many
applications
of
computing
have
become
distinct
areas
of
study
in
their
own
rights
Although
many
initially
believed
it
was
impossible
that
computers
themselves
could
actually
be
a
scientific
field
of
study
in
the
late
fifties
it
gradually
became
accepted
among
the
greater
academic
population
15
16
It
is
the
now
well
known
IBM
brand
that
formed
part
of
the
computer
science
revolution
during
this
time
IBM
short
for
International
Business
Machines
released
the
IBM
704
17
and
later
the
IBM
709
18
computers
which
were
widely
used
during
the
exploration
period
of
such
devices
Still
working
with
the
IBM
computer
was
frustrating
if
you
had
misplaced
as
much
as
one
letter
in
one
instruction
the
program
would
crash
and
you
would
have
to
start
the
whole
process
over
again
15
During
the
late
1950s
the
computer
science
discipline
was
very
much
in
its
developmental
stages
and
such
issues
were
commonplace
16
Time
has
seen
significant
improvements
in
the
usability
and
effectiveness
of
computing
technology
19
Modern
society
has
seen
a
significant
shift
in
the
users
of
computer
technology
from
usage
only
by
experts
and
professionals
to
a
near
ubiquitous
user
base
Initially
computers
were
quite
costly
and
some
degree
of
human
aid
was
needed
for
efficient
use
in
part
from
professional
computer
operators
As
computer
adoption
became
more
widespread
and
affordable
less
human
assistance
was
needed
for
common
usage

Etymology

Informatics
Etymology
Although
first
proposed
in
1956
16
the
term
computer
science
appears
in
a
1959
article
in
Communications
of
the
ACM
28
in
which
Louis
Fein
argues
for
the
creation
of
a
Graduate
School
in
Computer
Sciences
analogous
to
the
creation
of
Harvard
Business
School
in
1921
29
justifying
the
name
by
arguing
that
like
management
science
the
subject
is
applied
and
interdisciplinary
in
nature
while
having
the
characteristics
typical
of
an
academic
discipline
28
His
efforts
and
those
of
others
such
as
numerical
analyst
George
Forsythe
were
rewarded
universities
went
on
to
create
such
programs
starting
with
Purdue
in
1962
30
Despite
its
name
a
significant
amount
of
computer
science
does
not
involve
the
study
of
computers
themselves
Because
of
this
several
alternative
names
have
been
proposed
31
Certain
departments
of
major
universities
prefer
the
term
computing
science
to
emphasize
precisely
that
difference
Danish
scientist
Peter
Naur
suggested
the
term
datalogy
32
to
reflect
the
fact
that
the
scientific
discipline
revolves
around
data
and
data
treatment
while
not
necessarily
involving
computers
The
first
scientific
institution
to
use
the
term
was
the
Department
of
Datalogy
at
the
University
of
Copenhagen
founded
in
1969
with
Peter
Naur
being
the
first
professor
in
datalogy
The
term
is
used
mainly
in
the
Scandinavian
countries
An
alternative
term
also
proposed
by
Naur
is
data
science
this
is
now
used
for
a
distinct
field
of
data
analysis
including
statistics
and
databases
Also
in
the
early
days
of
computing
a
number
of
terms
for
the
practitioners
of
the
field
of
computing
were
suggested
in
the
Communications
of
the
ACM
turingineer
turologist
flow
charts
man
applied
meta
mathematician
and
applied
epistemologist
33
Three
months
later
in
the
same
journal
comptologist
was
suggested
followed
next
year
by
hypologist
34
The
term
computics
has
also
been
suggested
35
In
Europe
terms
derived
from
contracted
translations
of
the
expression
automatic
information
e
g
informazione
automatica
in
Italian
or
information
and
mathematics
are
often
used
e
g
informatique
French
Informatik
German
informatica
Italian
Dutch
inform
tica
Spanish
Portuguese
informatika
Slavic
languages
and
Hungarian
or
pliroforiki
which
means
informatics
in
Greek
Similar
words
have
also
been
adopted
in
the
UK
as
in
the
School
of
Informatics
of
the
University
of
Edinburgh
36
In
the
U
S
however
informatics
is
linked
with
applied
computing
or
computing
in
the
context
of
another
domain
37
A
folkloric
quotation
often
attributed
to
but
almost
certainly
not
first
formulated
by
Edsger
Dijkstra
states
that
computer
science
is
no
more
about
computers
than
astronomy
is
about
telescopes
note
3
The
design
and
deployment
of
computers
and
computer
systems
is
generally
considered
the
province
of
disciplines
other
than
computer
science
For
example
the
study
of
computer
hardware
is
usually
considered
part
of
computer
engineering
while
the
study
of
commercial
computer
systems
and
their
deployment
is
often
called
information
technology
or
information
systems
However
there
has
been
much
cross
fertilization
of
ideas
between
the
various
computer
related
disciplines
Computer
science
research
also
often
intersects
other
disciplines
such
as
philosophy
cognitive
science
linguistics
mathematics
physics
biology
statistics
and
logic
Computer
science
is
considered
by
some
to
have
a
much
closer
relationship
with
mathematics
than
many
scientific
disciplines
with
some
observers
saying
that
computing
is
a
mathematical
science
12
Early
computer
science
was
strongly
influenced
by
the
work
of
mathematicians
such
as
Kurt
G
del
Alan
Turing
R
zsa
P
ter
and
Alonzo
Church
and
there
continues
to
be
a
useful
interchange
of
ideas
between
the
two
fields
in
areas
such
as
mathematical
logic
category
theory
domain
theory
and
algebra
16
The
relationship
between
computer
science
and
software
engineering
is
a
contentious
issue
which
is
further
muddied
by
disputes
over
what
the
term
software
engineering
means
and
how
computer
science
is
defined
38
David
Parnas
taking
a
cue
from
the
relationship
between
other
engineering
and
science
disciplines
has
claimed
that
the
principal
focus
of
computer
science
is
studying
the
properties
of
computation
in
general
while
the
principal
focus
of
software
engineering
is
the
design
of
specific
computations
to
achieve
practical
goals
making
the
two
separate
but
complementary
disciplines
39
The
academic
political
and
funding
aspects
of
computer
science
tend
to
depend
on
whether
a
department
formed
with
a
mathematical
emphasis
or
with
an
engineering
emphasis
Computer
science
departments
with
a
mathematics
emphasis
and
with
a
numerical
orientation
consider
alignment
with
computational
science
Both
types
of
departments
tend
to
make
efforts
to
bridge
the
field
educationally
if
not
across
all
research
Philosophy
Main
article
Philosophy
of
computer
science
A
number
of
computer
scientists
have
argued
for
the
distinction
of
three
separate
paradigms
in
computer
science
Peter
Wegner
argued
that
those
paradigms
are
science
technology
and
mathematics
40
Peter
Denning
s
working
group
argued
that
they
are
theory
abstraction
modeling
and
design
41
Amnon
H
Eden
described
them
as
the
rationalist
paradigm
which
treats
computer
science
as
a
branch
of
mathematics
which
is
prevalent
in
theoretical
computer
science
and
mainly
employs
deductive
reasoning
the
technocratic
paradigm
which
might
be
found
in
engineering
approaches
most
prominently
in
software
engineering
and
the
scientific
paradigm
which
approaches
computer
related
artifacts
from
the
empirical
perspective
of
natural
sciences
identifiable
in
some
branches
of

the
fundamental
question
underlying
computer

is
What

automated
12
Theory
of

is
focused
on
answering
fundamental
questions
about
what
can
be

what
amount
of
resources
are
required
to
perform
those

In
an
effort
to
answer
the
first
question
computability
theory
examines
which

Formal
methods
Main

Formal
methods
Formal
methods
are
a
particular
kind
of
mathematically
based
technique
for
the
specification
development
and
verification
of
software
and
hardware
systems
The
use
of
formal
methods
for
software
and
hardware
design
is
motivated
by
the
expectation
that
as
in
other
engineering
disciplines
performing
appropriate
mathematical
analysis
can
contribute
to
the
reliability
and
robustness
of
a
design
They
form
an
important
theoretical
underpinning
for
software
engineering
especially
where
safety
or
security
is
involved
Formal
methods
are
a
useful
adjunct
to
software
testing
since
they
help
avoid
errors
and
can
also
give
a
framework
for
testing
For
industrial
use
tool
support
is
required
However
the
high
cost
of
using
formal
methods
means
that
they
are
usually
only
used
in
the
development
of
high
integrity
and
life
critical
systems
where
safety
or
security
is
of
utmost
importance
Formal
methods
are
best
described
as
the
application
of
a
fairly
broad
variety
of
theoretical
computer
science
fundamentals
in
particular
logic
calculi
formal
languages
automata
theory
and
program

From

AI
is
associated
in
the
popular
mind
with
robotic
development
but
the
main
field
of
practical
application
has
been
as
an
embedded
component
in
areas
of
software
development
which
require
computational
understanding
The
starting
point
in
the
late
1940s
was
Alan
Turing
s
question
Can
computers
think
and
the
question
remains
effectively
unanswered
although
the
Turing
test
is
still
used
to
assess
computer
output
on
the
scale
of
human
intelligence
But
the
automation
of
evaluative
and
predictive
tasks
has
been
increasingly
successful
as
a
substitute
for
human
monitoring

ways
of

into

that
are
needed
in
order
for

Only

the

One
proposed
explanation
for
this
is
the
quick
development
of
this
relatively
new
field
requires
rapid
review

Education
Since
computer
science
is
a
relatively
new
field
it
is
not
as
widely
taught
in
schools
and
universities
as
other
academic
subjects
For
example
in
2014
Code
org
estimated
that
only
10
percent
of
high
schools
in
the
United
States
offered
computer
science
education
54
A
2010
report
by
Association
for
Computing
Machinery
ACM
and
Computer
Science

Association
CSTA
revealed
that
only
14
out
of
50
states
have
adopted
significant
education
standards
for
high
school
computer
science
55
However
computer
science
education
is
growing
56
Some
countries
such
as
Israel
New
Zealand
and
South
Korea
have
already
included
computer
science
in
their
respective
national
secondary
education
curriculum
57
58
Several
countries
are
following
suit
59
In
most
countries
there
is
a
significant
gender
gap
in
computer
science
education
For
example
in
the
US
about
20
of
computer
science
degrees
in
2012
were
conferred
to
women
60
This
gender
gap
also
exists
in
other
Western
countries
61
However
in
some
parts
of
the
world
the
gap
is
small
or
nonexistent
In
2011
approximately
half
of
all
computer
science
degrees
in
Malaysia
were
conferred
to

Notes
In
1851
The
introduction
of
punched
cards
into
the
new
engine
was
important
not
only
as
a
more
convenient
form
of
control
than
the
drums
or
because
programs
could
now
be
of
unlimited
extent
and
could
be
stored
and
repeated
without
the
danger
of
introducing
errors
in
setting
the
machine
by
hand
it
was
important
also
because
it
served
to
crystallize
Babbage
s
feeling
that
he
had
invented
something
really
new
something
much
more
than
a

this
set
is
the
most
unique
and
possibly
the
most
useful
to
the
theoretical
computer
science
community
in
support
both
of
teaching
and
research
The
books
can
be
used
by
anyone
wanting
simply
to
gain
an
understanding
of
one
of
these
areas
or
by
someone
desiring
to
be
in
research
in
a
topic
or
by
instructors
wishing
to
find
timely
information
on
a
subject
they
are
teaching
outside
their
major
areas
of

its
interest
lies
not
only
in
the
content
of

still
timely

but
also
in
their
being

Spread
of
the
Black
Death
in
Europe
1346
1353
The
Black
Death
was
one
of
the
most
devastating
pandemics
in
human
history
resulting
in
the
deaths
of
an
estimated
75
to
200
million
people
in
Eurasia
and
peaking
in
Europe
in
the
years
1346
1353

Although
there
were
several
competing
theories
as
to
the
cause
of
the
Black
Death
analyses
of
DNA
from
people
in
northern
and
southern
Europe
published
in
2010
and
2011
indicate
that
the
pathogen
responsible
was
the
Yersinia
pestis
bacterium
resulting
in
several
forms
of
plague
including
the
bubonic
plague
4

The
Black
Death
is
thought
to
have
originated
in
the
arid
plains
of
Central
Asia
where
it
then
travelled
along
the
Silk
Road
reaching
Crimea
by
1343
6
From
there
it
was
most
likely
carried
by
Oriental
rat
fleas
living
on
the
black
rats
that
were
regular
passengers
on
merchant
ships
Spreading
throughout
the
Mediterranean
and
Europe
the
Black
Death
is
estimated
to
have
killed
30
60
of
Europe
s
total
population
7
In
total
the
plague
may
have
reduced
the
world
population
from
an
estimated
450
million
down
to
350
375
million
in
the
14th
century
8
The
world
population
as
a
whole
did
not
recover
to
pre
plague
levels
until
the
17th
century
9
The
plague
recurred
occasionally
in
Europe
until
the
19th
century
The
plague
created
a
series
of
religious
social
and
economic
upheavals
which
had
profound
effects
on
the
course
of
European
history

The
plague
disease
caused
by
Yersinia
pestis
is
enzootic
commonly
present
in
populations
of
fleas
carried
by
ground
rodents
including
marmots
in
various
areas
including
Central
Asia
Kurdistan
Western
Asia
Northern
India
and
Uganda
10
Nestorian
graves
dating
to
1338
1339
near
Lake
Issyk
Kul
in
Kyrgyzstan
have
inscriptions
referring
to
plague
and
are
thought
by
many
epidemiologists
to
mark
the
outbreak
of
the
epidemic
from
which
it
could
easily
have
spread
to
China
and
India
11
In
October
2010
medical
geneticists
suggested
that
all
three
of
the
great
waves
of
the
plague
originated
in
China
12
In
China
the
13th
century
Mongol
conquest
caused
a
decline
in
farming
and
trading
However
economic
recovery
had
been
observed
at
the
beginning
of
the
14th
century
In
the
1330s
a
large
number
of
natural
disasters
and
plagues
led
to
widespread
famine
starting
in
1331
with
a
deadly
plague
arriving
soon
after
13
Epidemics
that
may
have
included
plague
killed
an
estimated
25
million
Chinese
and
other
Asians
during
the
15
years
before
it
reached
Constantinople
in
1347
14
15
The
disease
may
have
travelled
along
the
Silk
Road
with
Mongol
armies
and
traders
or
it
could
have
come
via
ship
16
By
the
end
of
1346
reports
of
plague
had
reached
the
seaports
of
Europe
India
was
depopulated
Tartary
Mesopotamia
Syria
Armenia
were
covered
with
dead
bodies
17
Plague
was
reportedly
first
introduced
to
Europe
via
Genoese
traders
at
the
port
city
of
Kaffa
in
the
Crimea
in
1347
After
a
protracted
siege
during
which
the
Mongol
army
under
Jani
Beg
was
suffering
from
the
disease
the
army
catapulted
the
infected
corpses
over
the
city
walls
of
Kaffa
to
infect
the
inhabitants
The
Genoese
traders
fled
taking
the
plague
by
ship
into
Sicily
and
the
south
of
Europe
whence
it
spread
north
18
Whether
or
not
this
hypothesis
is
accurate
it
is
clear
that
several
existing
conditions
such
as
war
famine
and
weather
contributed
to
the
severity
of
the
Black
Death
European
outbreak
The
seventh
year
after
it
began
it
came
to
England
and
first
began
in
the
towns
and
ports
joining
on
the
seacoasts
in
Dorsetshire
where
as
in
other
counties
it
made
the
country
quite
void
of
inhabitants
so
that
there
were
almost
none
left
alive
But
at
length
it
came
to
Gloucester
yea
even
to
Oxford
and
to
London
and
finally
it
spread
over
all
England
and
so
wasted
the
people
that
scarce
the
tenth
person
of
any
sort
was
left
alive
Geoffrey
the
Baker
Chronicon
Angliae
There
appear
to
have
been
several
introductions
into
Europe
The
plague
reached
Sicily
in
October
1347
carried
by
twelve
Genoese
galleys
19
and
rapidly
spread
all
over
the
island
Galleys
from
Kaffa
reached
Genoa
and
Venice
in
January
1348
but
it
was
the
outbreak
in
Pisa
a
few
weeks
later
that
was
the
entry
point
to
northern
Italy
Towards
the
end
of
January
one
of
the
galleys
expelled
from
Italy
arrived
in
Marseille
20
From
Italy
the
disease
spread
northwest
across
Europe
striking
France
Spain
Portugal
and
England
by
June
1348
then
turned
and
spread
east
through
Germany
and
Scandinavia
from
1348
to
1350
It
was
introduced
in
Norway
in
1349
when
a
ship
landed
at
Ask
y
then
spread
to
Bj
rgvin
modern
Bergen
and
Iceland
21
Finally
it
spread
to
northwestern
Russia
in
1351
The
plague
was
somewhat
less
common
in
parts
of
Europe
that
had
smaller
trade
relations
with
their
neighbours
including
the
majority
of
the
Basque
Country
isolated
parts
of
Belgium
and
the
Netherlands
and
isolated
alpine
villages
throughout
the
continent
22

Modern
researchers
do
not
think
that
the
plague
ever
became
endemic
in
Europe
or
its
rat
population
The
disease
repeatedly
wiped
out
the
rodent
carriers
so
that
the
fleas
died
out
until
a
new
outbreak
from
Central
Asia
repeated
the
process
The
outbreaks
have
been
shown
to
occur
roughly
15
years
after
a
warmer
and
wetter
period
in
areas
where
plague
is
endemic
in
other
species
such
as
gerbils

Middle
Eastern
outbreak
The
plague
struck
various
regions
in
the
Middle
East
during
the
pandemic
leading
to
serious
depopulation
and
permanent
change
in
both
economic
and
social
structures
As
it
spread
to
western
Europe
the
disease
entered
the
region
from
southern
Russia
also
By
autumn
1347
the
plague
reached
Alexandria
in
Egypt
probably
through
the
port
s
trade
with
Constantinople
and
ports
on
the
Black
Sea
During
1347
the
disease
travelled
eastward
to
Gaza
and
north
along
the
eastern
coast
to
cities
in
Lebanon
Syria
and
Palestine
including
Ashkelon
Acre
Jerusalem
Sidon
Damascus
Homs
and
Aleppo
In
1348
1349
the
disease
reached
Antioch
The
city
s
residents
fled
to
the
north
most
of
them
dying
during
the
journey
but
the
infection
had
been
spread
to
the
people
of
Asia

Mecca
became
infected
in
1349
During
the
same
year
records
show
the
city
of
Mawsil
Mosul
suffered
a
massive
epidemic
and
the
city
of
Baghdad
experienced
a
second
round
of
the
disease
In
1351
Yemen
experienced
an
outbreak
of
the
plague
coinciding
with
the
return
of
Sultan
al

of
Yemen
from

Swollen

occur
in
the
neck
armpit
and
groin
inguinal
regions
of
plague
victims
Contemporary
accounts
of
the
plague
are
often
varied
or
imprecise
The
most
commonly
noted
symptom
was
the
appearance
of
buboes
or
gavocciolos
in
the
groin
the
neck
and
armpits
which
oozed
pus
and
bled
when
opened
26
Boccaccio
s
description
is
graphic
In
men
and
women
alike
it
first
betrayed
itself
by
the
emergence
of
certain
tumours
in
the
groin
or
armpits
some
of
which
grew
as
large
as
a
common
apple
others
as
an
egg
From
the
two
said
parts
of
the
body
this
deadly
gavocciolo
soon
began
to
propagate
and
spread
itself
in
all
directions
indifferently
after
which
the
form
of
the
malady
began
to
change
black
spots
or
livid
making
their
appearance
in
many
cases
on
the
arm
or
the
thigh
or
elsewhere
now
few
and
large
now
minute
and
numerous
As
the
gavocciolo
had
been
and
still
was
an
infallible
token
of
approaching
death
such
also
were
these
spots
on
whomsoever
they
showed
themselves
27
The
only
medical
detail
that
is
questionable
in
Boccaccio
s
description
is
that
the
gavocciolo
was
an
infallible
token
of
approaching
death
as
if
the
bubo
discharges
recovery
is
possible
28
This
was
followed
by
acute
fever
and
vomiting
of
blood
Most
victims
died
two
to
seven
days
after
initial
infection
Freckle
like
spots
and
rashes
29
which
could
have
been
caused
by
flea
bites
were
identified
as
another
potential
sign
of
the
plague
Some
accounts
like
that
of
Lodewijk
Heyligen
whose
master
the
Cardinal
Colonna
died
of
the
plague
in
1348
noted
a
distinct
form
of
the
disease
that
infected
the
lungs
and
led
to
respiratory
problems
26
and
is
identified
with
pneumonic
plague
It
is
said
that
the
plague
takes
three
forms
In
the
first
people
suffer
an
infection
of
the
lungs
which
leads
to
breathing
difficulties
Whoever
has
this
corruption
or
contamination
to
any
extent
cannot
escape
but
will
die
within
two
days
Another
form
in
which
boils
erupt
under
the
armpits
a
third
form
in
which
people
of
both
sexes
are
attacked
in
the
groin

the
organism
responsible
for

Medical
knowledge
had
stagnated
during
the
Middle
Ages
The
most
authoritative
account
at
the
time
came
from
the
medical
faculty
in
Paris
in
a
report
to
the
king
of
France
that
blamed
the
heavens
in
the
form
of
a
conjunction
of
three
planets
in
1345
that
caused
a
great
pestilence
in
the
air
32
This
report
became
the
first
and
most
widely
circulated
of
a
series
of
plague
tracts
that
sought
to
give
advice
to
sufferers
That
the
plague
was
caused
by
bad
air
became
the
most
widely
accepted
theory
Today
this
is
known
as
the
miasma
theory
The
word
plague
had
no
special
significance
at
this
time
and
only
the
recurrence
of
outbreaks
during
the
Middle
Ages
gave
it
the
name
that
has
become
the
medical
term
The
importance
of
hygiene
was
recognised
only
in
the
nineteenth
century
until
then
it
was
common
that
the
streets
were
filthy
with
live
animals
of
all
sorts
around
and
human
parasites
abounding
A
transmissible
disease
will
spread
easily
in
such
conditions
One
development
as
a
result
of
the
Black
Death
was
the
establishment
of
the
idea
of
quarantine
in
Dubrovnik
in
1377
after
continuing
outbreaks
33
The
dominant
explanation
for
the
Black
Death
is
the
plague
theory
which
attributes
the
outbreak
to
Yersinia
pestis
also
responsible
for
an
epidemic
that
began
in
southern
China
in
1865
eventually
spreading
to
India
The
investigation
of
the
pathogen
that
caused
the
19th
century
plague
was
begun
by
teams
of
scientists
who
visited
Hong
Kong
in
1894
among
whom
was
the
French
Swiss
bacteriologist
Alexandre
Yersin
after
whom
the
pathogen
was
named
Yersinia
pestis
34
The
mechanism
by
which
Y
pestis
was
usually
transmitted
was
established
in
1898
by
Paul
Louis
Simond
and
was
found
to
involve
the
bites
of
fleas
whose
midguts
had
become
obstructed
by
replicating
Y
pestis
several
days
after
feeding
on
an
infected
host
This
blockage
results
in
starvation
and
aggressive
feeding
behaviour
by
the
fleas
which
repeatedly
attempt
to
clear
their
blockage
by
regurgitation
resulting
in
thousands
of
plague
bacteria
being
flushed
into
the
feeding
site
infecting
the
host
The
bubonic
plague
mechanism
was
also
dependent
on
two
populations
of
rodents
one
resistant
to
the
disease
which
act
as
hosts
keeping
the
disease
endemic
and
a
second
that
lack
resistance
When
the
second
population
dies
the
fleas
move
on
to
other
hosts
including
people
thus
creating
a
human
epidemic
34
The
historian
Francis
Aidan
Gasquet
wrote
about
the
Great
Pestilence
in
1893
35
and
suggested
that
it
would
appear
to
be
some
form
of
the
ordinary
Eastern
or
bubonic
plague
He
was
able
to
adopt
the
epidemiology
of
the
bubonic
plague
for
the
Black
Death
for
the
second
edition
in
1908
implicating
rats
and
fleas
in
the
process
and
his
interpretation
was
widely
accepted
for
other
ancient
and
medieval
epidemics
such
as
the
Justinian
plague
that
was
prevalent
in
the
Eastern
Roman
Empire
from
541
to
700
CE
34
An
estimate
of
the
mortality
rate
for
the
modern
bubonic
plague
following
the
introduction
of
antibiotics
is
11
by
the
US
Centers
for
Disease
Control
CDC
although
it
may
be
much
higher
in
economically
or
medically
underdeveloped
regions
36
Symptoms
of
the
disease
include
fever
of
38
41
C
100
106
F
headaches
painful
aching
joints
nausea
and
vomiting
and
a
general
feeling
of
malaise
Left
untreated
of
those
that
contract
the
bubonic
plague
80
per
cent
die
within
eight
days
37
Pneumonic
plague
has
a
mortality
rate
of
90
to
95
per
cent
Symptoms
include
fever
cough
and
blood
tinged
sputum
As
the
disease
progresses
sputum
becomes
free
flowing
and
bright
red
Septicemic
plague
is
the
least
common
of
the
three
forms
with
a
mortality
rate
near
100
Symptoms
are
high
fevers
and
purple
skin
patches
purpura
due
to
disseminated
intravascular
coagulation
In
cases
of
pneumonic
and
particularly
septicemic
plague
the
progress
of
the
disease
is
so
rapid
that
there
would
often
be
no
time
for
the
development
of
the
enlarged
lymph
nodes
that
were
noted
as
buboes
38
A
number
of
alternative
theories
implicating
other
diseases
in
the
Black
Death
pandemic
have
also
been
proposed
by
some
modern
scientists

bubonic
plague
was
active
in
Europe
from
AD
1347
the
beginning
of
the
Black
Death
until
1750
In
October
2010
the
open
access
scientific
journal
PLoS
Pathogens
published
a
paper
by
a
multinational
team
who
undertook
a
new
investigation
into
the
role
of
Yersinia
pestis
in
the
Black
Death
following
the
disputed
identification
by
Drancourt
and
Raoult
in
1998
They
assessed
the
presence
of
DNA
RNA
with
polymerase
chain
reaction
PCR
techniques
for
Y
pestis
from
the
tooth
sockets
in
human
skeletons
from
mass
graves
in
northern
central
and
southern
Europe
that
were
associated
archaeologically
with
the
Black
Death
and
subsequent
resurgences
The
authors
concluded
that
this
new
research
together
with
prior
analyses
from
the
south
of
France
and
Germany
39
ends
the
debate
about
the
cause
of
the
Black
Death
and
unambiguously
demonstrates
that
Y
pestis
was
the
causative
agent
of
the
epidemic
plague
that
devastated
Europe
during
the
Middle
Ages
40
The
study
also
found
that
there
were
two
previously
unknown
but
related
clades
genetic
branches
of
the
Y
pestis
genome
associated
with
medieval
mass
graves
These
clades
which
are
thought
to
be
extinct
were
found
to
be
ancestral
to
modern
isolates
of
the
modern
Y
pestis
strains
Y
p
orientalis
and
Y
p
medievalis
suggesting
the
plague
may
have
entered
Europe
in
two
waves
Surveys
of
plague
pit
remains
in
France
and
England
indicate
the
first
variant
entered
Europe
through
the
port
of
Marseille
around
November
1347
and
spread
through
France
over
the
next
two
years
eventually
reaching
England
in
the
spring
of
1349
where
it
spread
through
the
country
in
three
epidemics
Surveys
of
plague
pit
remains
from
the
Dutch
town
of
Bergen
op
Zoom
showed
the
Y
pestis
genotype
responsible
for
the
pandemic
that
spread
through
the
Low
Countries
from
1350
differed
from
that
found
in
Britain
and
France
implying
Bergen
op
Zoom
and
possibly
other
parts
of
the
southern
Netherlands
was
not
directly
infected
from
England
or
France
in
1349
and
suggesting
a
second
wave
of
plague
different
from
those
in
Britain
and
France
may
have
been
carried
to
the
Low
Countries
from
Norway
the
Hanseatic
cities
or
another
site
40
The
results
of
the
Haensch
study
have
since
been
confirmed
and
amended
Based
on
genetic
evidence
derived
from
Black
Death
victims
in
the
East
Smithfield
burial
site
in
England
Schuenemann
et
al
concluded
in
2011
that
the
Black
Death
in
medieval
Europe
was
caused
by
a
variant
of
Y
pestis
that
may
no
longer
exist
41
A
study
published
in
Nature
in
October
2011
sequenced
the
genome
of
Y
pestis
from
plague
victims
and
indicated
that
the
strain
that
caused
the
Black
Death
is
ancestral
to
most
modern
strains
of
the
disease
5
DNA
taken
from
25
skeletons
from
the
14th
century
found
in
London
have
shown
the
plague
is
a
strain
of
Y
pestis
that
is
almost
identical
to
that
which
hit
Madagascar
in
2013

Alternative
explanations
Main
article
Theories
of
the
Black
Death
The
plague
theory
was
first
significantly
challenged
by
the
work
of
British
bacteriologist
J
F
D
Shrewsbury
in
1970
who
noted
that
the
reported
rates
of
mortality
in
rural
areas
during
the
14th
century
pandemic
were
inconsistent
with
the
modern
bubonic
plague
leading
him
to
conclude
that
contemporary
accounts
were
exaggerations
34
In
1984
zoologist
Graham
Twigg
produced
the
first
major
work
to
challenge
the
bubonic
plague
theory
directly
and
his
doubts
about
the
identity
of
the
Black
Death
have
been
taken
up
by
a
number
of
authors
including
Samuel
K
Cohn
Jr
2002
and
2013
David
Herlihy
1997
and
Susan
Scott
and
Christopher
Duncan
2001
34
It
is
recognised
that
an
epidemiological
account
of
the
plague
is
as
important
as
an
identification
of
symptoms
but
researchers
are
hampered
by
the
lack
of
reliable
statistics
from
this
period
Most
work
has
been
done
on
the
spread
of
the
plague
in
England
and
even
estimates
of
overall
population
at
the
start
vary
by
over
100
as
no
census
was
undertaken
between
the
time
of
publication
of
the
Domesday
Book
and
the
year
1377
44
Estimates
of
plague
victims
are
usually
extrapolated
from
figures
from
the
clergy
In
addition
to
arguing
that
the
rat
population
was
insufficient
to
account
for
a
bubonic
plague
pandemic
sceptics
of
the
bubonic
plague
theory
point
out
that
the
symptoms
of
the
Black
Death
are
not
unique
and
arguably
in
some
accounts
may
differ
from
bubonic
plague
that
transference
via
fleas
in
goods
was
likely
to
be
of
marginal
significance
and
that
the
DNA
results
may
be
flawed
and
might
not
have
been
repeated
elsewhere
despite
extensive
samples
from
other
mass
graves
34
Other
arguments
include
the
lack
of
accounts
of
the
death
of
rats
before
outbreaks
of
plague
between
the
14th
and
17th
centuries
temperatures
that
are
too
cold
in
northern
Europe
for
the
survival
of
fleas
that
despite
primitive
transport
systems
the
spread
of
the
Black
Death
was
much
faster
than
that
of
modern
bubonic
plague
that
mortality
rates
of
the
Black
Death
appear
to
be
very
high
that
while
modern
bubonic
plague
is
largely
endemic
as
a
rural
disease
the
Black
Death
indiscriminately
struck
urban
and
rural
areas
and
that
the
pattern
of
the
Black
Death
with
major
outbreaks
in
the
same
areas
separated
by
5
to
15
years
differs
from
modern
bubonic
plague
which
often
becomes
endemic
for
decades
with
annual
flare
ups
34
McCormick
has
suggested
that
earlier
archaeologists
were
simply
not
interested
in
the
laborious
processes
needed
to
discover
rat
remains
45
Wall
e
complains
that
all
of
these
authors
take
it
for
granted
that
Simond
s
infection
model
black
rat
rat
flea
human
which
was
developed
to
explain
the
spread
of
plague
in
India
is
the
only
way
an
epidemic
of
Yersinia
pestis
infection
could
spread
whilst
pointing
to
several
other
possibilities
46
Similarly
Green
has
argued
that
greater
attention
is
needed
to
the
range
of
especially
non
commensal
animals
that
might
be
involved
in
the
transmission
of
plague
47
Anthrax
skin
lesion
A
variety
of
alternatives
to
the
Y
pestis
have
been
put
forward
Twigg
suggested
that
the
cause
was
a
form
of
anthrax
and
Norman
Cantor
2001
thought
it
may
have
been
a
combination
of
anthrax
and
other
pandemics
Scott
and
Duncan
have
argued
that
the
pandemic
was
a
form
of
infectious
disease
that
they
characterise
as
hemorrhagic
plague
similar
to
Ebola
Archaeologist
Barney
Sloane
has
argued
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence
of
the
extinction
of
a
large
number
of
rats
in
the
archaeological
record
of
the
medieval
waterfront
in
London
and
that
the
plague
spread
too
quickly
to
support
the
thesis
that
the
Y
pestis
was
spread
from
fleas
on
rats
he
argues
that
transmission
must
have
been
person
to
person
48
49
However
no
single
alternative
solution
has
achieved
widespread
acceptance
34
Many
scholars
arguing
for
the
Y
pestis
as
the
major
agent
of
the
pandemic
suggest
that
its
extent
and
symptoms
can
be
explained
by
a
combination
of
bubonic
plague
with
other
diseases
including
typhus
smallpox
and
respiratory
infections
In
addition
to
the
bubonic
infection
others
point
to
additional
septicemic
a
type
of
blood
poisoning
and
pneumonic
an
airborne
plague
that
attacks
the
lungs
before
the
rest
of
the
body
forms
of
the
plague
which
lengthen
the
duration
of
outbreaks
throughout
the
seasons
and
help
account
for
its
high
mortality
rate
and
additional
recorded
symptoms
26
In
2014
scientists
with
Public
Health
England
announced
the
results
of
an
examination
of
25
bodies
exhumed
from
the
Clerkenwell
area
of
London
as
well
as
of
wills
registered
in
London
during
the
period
which
supported
the
pneumonic
hypothesis

According
to
medieval
historian
Philip
Daileader
in
2007
The
trend
of
recent
research
is
pointing
to
a
figure
more
like
45
50
of
the
European
population
dying
during
a
four
year
period
There
is
a
fair
amount
of
geographic
variation
In
Mediterranean
Europe
areas
such
as
Italy
the
south
of
France
and
Spain
where
plague
ran
for
about
four
years
consecutively
it
was
probably
closer
to
75
80
of
the
population
In
Germany
and
England
it
was
probably
closer
to
20
51
A
death
rate
as
high
as
60
in
Europe
has
been
suggested
by
Norwegian
historian
Ole
Benedictow
Detailed
study
of
the
mortality
data
available
points
to
two
conspicuous
features
in
relation
to
the
mortality
caused
by
the
Black
Death
namely
the
extreme
level
of
mortality
caused
by
the
Black
Death
and
the
remarkable
similarity
or
consistency
of
the
level
of
mortality
from
Spain
in
southern
Europe
to
England
in
north
western
Europe
The
data
is
sufficiently
widespread
and
numerous
to
make
it
likely
that
the
Black
Death
swept
away
around
60
per
cent
of
Europe
s
population
It
is
generally
assumed
that
the
size
of
Europe
s
population
at
the
time
was
around
80
million
This
implies
that
around
50
million
people
died
in
the
Black
Death
52
The
most
widely
accepted
estimate
for
the
Middle
East
including
Iraq
Iran
and
Syria
during
this
time
is
for
a
death
rate
of
about
a
third
53
The
Black
Death
killed
about
40
of
Egypt
s
population
54
Half
of
Paris
s
population
of
100
000
people
died
In
Italy
the
population
of
Florence
was
reduced
from
110
000
120
000
inhabitants
in
1338
down
to
50
000
in
1351
At
least
60
of
the
population
of
Hamburg
and
Bremen
perished
55
and
a
similar
percentage
of
Londoners
may
have
died
from
the
disease
as
well
42
While
contemporary
reports
account
of
mass
burial
pits
being
created
in
response
to
the
large
numbers
of
dead
recent
scientific
investigations
of
a
burial
pit
in
Central
London
found
well
preserved
individuals
to
be
buried
in
isolated
evenly
spaced
graves
suggesting
at
least
some
pre
planning
and
Christian
burials
at
this
time
56
Before
1350
there
were
about
170
000
settlements
in
Germany
and
this
was
reduced
by
nearly
40
000
by
1450
57
In
1348
the
plague
spread
so
rapidly
that
before
any
physicians
or
government
authorities
had
time
to
reflect
upon
its
origins
about
a
third
of
the
European
population
had
already
perished
In
crowded
cities
it
was
not
uncommon
for
as
much
as
50
of
the
population
to
die
34
The
disease
bypassed
some
areas
and
the
most
isolated
areas
were
less
vulnerable
to
contagion
Monks
and
priests
were
especially
hard
hit
since
they
cared
for
victims
of

on
the
universality

was
a
common

in
the
late
medieval
period
Renewed
religious
fervour
and
fanaticism
bloomed
in
the
wake
of
the
Black

Some
Europeans
targeted
various
groups
such
as
Jews
friars
foreigners
beggars
pilgrims
59
lepers
59
60
and
Romani
thinking
that
they
were

for
the
crisis
Lepers
and
other
individuals
with
skin
diseases
such
as
acne
or
psoriasis
were
singled
out
and
exterminated
throughout
Europe
Because
14th
century
healers
were
at
a
loss
to
explain
the
cause
Europeans
turned
to
astrological
forces
earthquakes
and
the
poisoning
of
wells
by
Jews
as
possible
reasons
for
the
plague
s
emergence
61
The
governments
of
Europe
had
no
apparent
response
to

because
no
one
knew
its

or
how
it
spread
The
mechanism
of
infection
and
transmission
of

was
little
understood
in

outbreaks
in
Australia
between

resulted
in
well
over

chiefly
in

This
led
to
the
establishment
of
a
Public
Health
Department
there
which
undertook
some
leading
edge
research
on
plague
transmission
from
rat

the
phrase
black

to
refer
to
a

fever

108
Writers
contemporary
with
the
plague
referred
to
the
event
as
the
Great
Mortality
109
or
the
Great
Plague
61
The
phrase
black
death
mors
nigra
was
used
in
1350
by
Simon
de
Covino
or
Couvin
a
Belgian
astronomer
who
wrote
the
poem
On
the
Judgment
of
the
Sun
at
a
Feast
of
Saturn
De
judicio
Solis
in
convivio
Saturni
which
attributes
the
plague
to
a
conjunction
of
Jupiter
and
Saturn
110
In
1908
Gasquet
claimed
that
use
of
the
name
atra
mors
for
the
14th
century
epidemic
first
appeared
in
a
1631
book
on
Danish
history
by
J
I
Pontanus
Commonly
and
from
its
effects
they
called
it
the
black
death
Vulgo
ab
effectu
atram
mortem
vocatibant
111
The
name
spread
through
Scandinavia
and
then
Germany
gradually
becoming
attached
to
the
mid
14th
century
epidemic
as
a
proper
name
112
In
England
it
was
not
until
1823
that
the
medieval
epidemic
was
first
called
the
Black
Death

Duke
Albert
IV
and
St
John
from

ll
abbey
today
in
Bavarian
National

a
son
of
Albert
III
Duke
of
Bavaria
and
Anna
of
Brunswick
Grubenhagen
Einbeck
After
the
death
of
his
older
brother
John
IV
Duke
of
Bavaria
he
gave
up
his
spiritual
career
and
returned
from
Pavia
to
Munich
When
his
brothers
Christoph
and
Wolfgang
had
resigned
Albert
became
sole
duke
but
a
new
duchy
Bavaria
Dachau
was
created
from
Bavaria
Munich
for
his
brother
Duke
Sigismund
in
1467
After
Sigismund
s
death
in
1501
it
reverted
to
Bavaria
Munich
The
marriage
of
Kunigunde
of
Austria
to
Albert
IV
was
a
result
of
intrigues
and
deception
but
must
be
counted
as
a
defeat
for
emperor
Frederick
III
Albert
illegally
took
control
of
some
imperial
fiefs
and
then
asked
to
marry
Kunigunde
who
lived
in
Innsbruck
far
from
her
father
offering
to
give
her
the
fiefs
as
a
dowry
Frederick
agreed
at
first
but
after
Albert
took
over
yet
another
fief
Regensburg
Frederick
withdrew
his
consent
On
January
2
1487
however
before
Frederick
s
change
of
heart
could
be
communicated
to
his
daughter
Kunigunde
married
Albert
A
war
was
prevented
only
by
intermediation
by
the
Emperor
s
son
Maximilian
For
Albert
s
wedding
the
Gr
nwald
castle
was
extended
in
1486
87
by
J
rg
von
Weikertshausen
Albert
finally
decided
to
return
territorial
acquisitions
in
Swabia
in
1492
to
avoid
a
war
with
the
Habsburg
and
the
Swabian
League
He
then
also
had
to
release
Regensburg
which
had
been
reunited
with
Bavaria
in
1486
and
had
to
renounce
Further
Austria
when
Sigismund
Archduke
of
Austria
tried
to
make
it
over
to
Albert
After
the
death
of
the
last
duke
of
Bavaria
Landshut
George
in
1503
Albert
managed
to
reunite
the
whole
of
Bavaria
in
a
dreadful
war
against
George
s
heirs
the
Palatinate
line
of
his
Wittelsbach
family
but
had
to
transfer
the
most
southern
districts
of
Bavaria
Landshut
to
his
brother
in
law
Emperor
Maximilian
as
compensation
for
his
support
Kufstein
Kitzb
hel
and
Rattenberg
passed
to
Maximilian
in
1506
and
were
united
with
Tyrol
For
the
Palatinate
branch
a
new
duchy
of
Palatinate
Neuburg
was
created
To
avoid
any
future
division
of
Bavaria
Albert
decreed
the
everlasting
succession
of
the
firstborn
prince
in
1506
Nevertheless
his
oldest
son
and
successor
William
IV
Duke
of
Bavaria
had
to
share
his
power
from
1516
onwards
with
his
younger
brother
Louis
X
Duke
of
Bavaria
After
the
death
of
Louis
in
1545
the
edict
became
effective

The
War
of
the
Succession
of

resulted
from
a
dispute
between
the
duchies
of
Bavaria
Munich
Bayern
M
nchen
in
German
and
Bavaria
Landshut
Bayern
Landshut
An
earlier
agreement
between
the
different
Wittelsbach
lines
the
Treaty
of
Pavia
1329
concerned
the
law
of
succession
and
stated
that
if
one
branch
should
become
extinct
in
the
male
line
then
the
other
would
inherit
This
agreement
disregarded
imperial
law
which
stipulated
that
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
should
inherit
should
a
line
fail
George
Duke
of
Bavaria
Landshut
and
his
wife
Hedwig
Jagiellon
failed
to
produce
a
male
heir
so
George
in
a
breach
of
both
imperial
law
at
the
one
hand
the
house
treaty
at
the
other
named
his
daughter
Elisabeth
as
his
heir
Because
of
the
agreement
Duke
Albert
of
the
Munich
line
did
not
accept
this
leading
to
war
in
1503
Over
the
course
of
this
two
year
war
many
villages
surrounding
Landshut
were
reduced
to
ashes
such
as
Ergolding
The
war
ended
in
1505
with
the
death
of
Elisabeth
and
her
husband
Ruprecht
Count
Palatine
of
the
Rhine
and
a
decision
through
arbitration
by
Emperor
Maximilian
I
on
30
July
1505
at
the
Diet
of
Cologne
The
two
grandsons
of
George
Otto
Henry
Otto
Heinrich
and
Philip
retained
Palatinate
Neuburg
Junge
Pfalz
a
fragmented
region
from
the
upper
Danube
over
Franconia
to
the
northern
part
of
the
Upper
Palatinate
Neuburg
an
der
Donau
was
chosen
as
the
capital
of
the
new
state
Because
the
two
heirs
had
not
yet
reached
their
majority
Frederick
II
Count
Palatine
of
the
Rhine
served
as
regent
in
a
caretaker
regime
The
rest
of
the
territory
went
to
the
Munich
line
of
the
House
of
Wittelsbach
The
emperor
took
the
territory
around
Kufstein
for
himself
as
reward
for
his
mediation
the
Imperial
City
of
Nuremberg
gained
important
territories
to
the
east
of
the
city
including
the
authorities
of
Lauf
Hersbruck
and
Altdorf
As
Count
Palatine
Otto
Heinrich
spent
huge
sums
of
money
to
build
a
palace
at
Neuburg
an
der
Donau
Through
inheritance
he
later
became
Elector
Palatine
where
his
additions
Ottheinrichsbau
to
Heidelberg
Castle
made
him
one
of
the
most
important
builders
of
the
German
Renaissance

The
German
Renaissance
part
of
the
Northern
Renaissance
was
a
cultural
and
artistic
movement
that
spread
among
German
thinkers
in
the
15th
and
16th
centuries
which
developed
from
the
Italian
Renaissance
Many
areas
of
the
arts
and
sciences
were
influenced
notably
by
the
spread
of
Renaissance
humanism
to
the
various
German
states
and
principalities
There
were
many
advances
made
in
the
fields
of
architecture
the
arts
and
the
sciences
Germany
produced
two
developments
that
were
to
dominate

16th
century

over
Europe
printing
and
the
Protestant
Reformation
One
of
the
most
important
German
humanists
was
Konrad
Celtis
1459
1508
Celtis
studied
at
Cologne
and
Heidelberg
and
later
travelled
throughout
Italy
collecting
Latin
and
Greek
manuscripts
Heavily
influenced
by
Tacitus
he
used
the
Germania
to
introduce
German
history
and
geography
Eventually
he
devoted
his
time
to
poetry
in
which
he
praised
Germany
in
Latin
Another
important
figure
was
Johann
Reuchlin
1455
1522
who
studied
in
various
places
in
Italy
and
later
taught
Greek
He
studied
the
Hebrew
language
aiming
to
purify
Christianity
but
encountering
resistance
from
the
church
The
most
significant
German
Renaissance
artist
is
Albrecht

Background
edit
The
Renaissance
was
largely
driven
by
the
renewed
interest
in
classical
learning
and
was
also
the
result
of
rapid
economic
development
At
the
beginning
of
the
16th
century
Germany
was
one
of
the
most
prosperous
countries
in
Europe
despite
a
relatively
low
level
of
urbanization
compared
to
Italy
or
the
Netherlands

The
Heller
altar
by
Albrecht
D
rer
The
concept
of
the
Northern
Renaissance
or
German
Renaissance
is
somewhat
confused
by
the
continuation
of
the
use
of
elaborate
Gothic
ornament
until
well
into
the
16th
century
even
in
works
that
are
undoubtedly
Renaissance
in
their
treatment
of
the
human
figure
and
other
respects
Classical
ornament
had
little
historical
resonance
in
much
of
Germany
but
in
other
respects
Germany
was
very
quick
to
follow
developments
especially
in
adopting
printing
with
movable
type
a
German
invention
that
remained
almost
a
German
monopoly
for
some
decades
and
was
first
brought
to
most
of
Europe
including
France
and
Italy
by
Germans

Printmaking
by
woodcut
and
engraving
thought
of
as
a
German
invention
yet
originated
in
China
was
already
more
developed
in
Germany
and
the
Low
Countries
than
anywhere
else
and
the
Germans
took
the
lead
in
developing
book
illustrations
typically
of
a
relatively
low
artistic
standard
but
seen
all
over
Europe
with
the
woodblocks
often
being
lent
to
printers
of
editions
in
other
cities
or
languages
The
greatest
artist
of
the
German
Renaissance
Albrecht
D
rer
began
his
career
as
an
apprentice
to
a
leading
workshop
in
Nuremberg
that
of
Michael
Wolgemut
who
had
largely
abandoned
his
painting
to
exploit
the
new
medium
D
rer
worked
on
the
most
extravagantly
illustrated
book
of
the
period
the
Nuremberg
Chronicle
published
by
his
godfather
Anton
Koberger
Europe
s
largest
printer
publisher
at
the
time
2
After
completing
his
apprenticeship
in
1490
D
rer
travelled
in
Germany
for
four
years
and
Italy
for
a
few
months
before
establishing
his
own
workshop
in
Nuremberg
He
rapidly
became
famous
all
over
Europe
for
his
energetic
and
balanced
woodcuts
and
engravings
while
also
painting
Though
retaining
a
distinctively
German
style
his
work
shows
strong
Italian
influence
and
is
often
taken
to
represent
the
start
of
the
German
Renaissance
in
visual
art
which
for
the
next
forty
years
replaced
the
Netherlands
and
France
as
the
area
producing
the
greatest
innovation
in
Northern
European
art
D
rer
supported
Martin
Luther
but
continued
to
create
Madonnas
and
other
Catholic
imagery
and
paint
portraits
of
leaders
on
both
sides
of
the
emerging
split
of
the
Protestant
Reformation
2
The
Crucifixion
central
panel
of
the
Isenheim
Altarpiece
by
Matthias
Gr
newald
D
rer
died
in
1528
before
it
was
clear
that
the
split
of
the
Reformation
had
become
permanent
but
his
pupils
of
the
following
generation
were
unable
to
avoid
taking
sides
Most
leading
German
artists
became
Protestants
but
this
deprived
them
of
painting
most
religious
works
previously
the
mainstay
of
artists
revenue
Martin
Luther
had
objected
to
much
Catholic
imagery
but
not
to
imagery
itself
and
Lucas
Cranach
the
Elder
a
close
friend
of
Luther
had
painted
a
number
of
Lutheran
altarpieces
mostly
showing
the
Last
Supper
some
with
portraits
of
the
leading
Protestant
divines
as
the
Twelve
Apostles
This
phase
of
Lutheran
art
was
over
before
1550
probably
under
the
more
fiercely
aniconic
influence
of
Calvinism
and
religious
works
for
public
display
virtually
ceased
to
be
produced
in
Protestant
areas
Presumably
largely
because
of
this
the
development
of
German
art
had
virtually
ceased
by
about
1550
but
in
the
preceding
decades
German
artists
had
been
very
fertile
in
developing
alternative
subjects
to
replace
the
gap
in
their
order
books
Cranach
apart
from
portraits
developed
a
format
of
thin
vertical
portraits
of
provocative
nudes
given
classical
or
Biblical
titles
3
Lying
somewhat
outside
these
developments
is
Matthias
Gr
newald
who
left
very
few
works
but
whose
masterpiece
his
Isenheim
Altarpiece
completed
1515
has
been
widely
regarded
as
the
greatest
German
Renaissance
painting
since
it
was
restored
to
critical
attention
in
the
19th
century
It
is
an
intensely
emotional
work
that
continues
the
German
Gothic
tradition
of
unrestrained
gesture
and
expression
using
Renaissance
compositional
principles
but
all
in
that
most
Gothic
of
forms

the
earliest
Western
pure

the
Danube
School

southern
Germany
The
Danube
School
is
the
name
of
a
circle
of
artists
of
the
first
third
of
the
16th
century
in
Bavaria
and
Austria
including
Albrecht
Altdorfer
Wolf
Huber
and
Augustin
Hirschvogel
With
Altdorfer
in
the
lead
the
school
produced
the
first
examples
of

landscape
art
in
the
West
nearly
1
000
years
after

paintings
and

Hans
Holbein
the
Elder
and
his
brother
Sigismund
Holbein
painted
religious
works
in
the
late
Gothic
style
Hans
the
Elder
was
a
pioneer
and
leader
in
the
transformation
of
German
art
from
the
Gothic
to
the
Renaissance
style
His
son
Hans
Holbein
the
Younger
was
an
important
painter
of
portraits
and
a
few
religious
works
working
mainly
in
England
and
Switzerland
Holbein
s
well
known
series
of
small
woodcuts
on
the
Dance
of
Death
relate
to
the
works
of
the
Little
Masters
a
group
of
printmakers
who
specialized
in
very
small
and
highly
detailed
engravings
for
bourgeois
collectors
including
many
erotic
subjects

The
outstanding
achievements
of
the
first
half
of
the
16th
century
were
followed
by
several
decades
with
a
remarkable
absence
of
noteworthy
German
art
other
than
accomplished
portraits
that
never
rival
the
achievement
of
Holbein
or
D
rer
The
next
significant
German
artists
worked
in
the
rather
artificial
style
of
Northern
Mannerism
which
they
had
to
learn
in
Italy
or
Flanders
Hans
von
Aachen
and
the
Netherlandish
Bartholomeus
Spranger
were
the
leading
painters
at
the
Imperial
courts
in
Vienna
and
Prague
and
the
productive
Netherlandish
Sadeler
family
of
engravers
spread
out
across
Germany
among
other
counties

In
Catholic
parts
of
South
Germany
the
Gothic
tradition
of
wood
carving
continued
to
flourish
until
the
end
of
the

changes
in

Architecture
in

Johannes
Gutenberg
is
widely
considered
the
most
influential
person
within
the
German
Renaissance
As
a
free
thinker
humanist
and
inventor
Gutenberg
also
grew
up
within
the
Renaissance
but
influenced
it
greatly
as
well
His
best
known
invention
is
the
printing
press
in
1440
Gutenberg
s
press
allowed
the
humanists
reformists
and
others
to
circulate
their
ideas
He
is
also
known
as
the
creator
of
the
Gutenberg
Bible
a
crucial
work
that
marked
the
start
of
the
Gutenberg
Revolution
and
the
age
of

Johann
Reuchlin
1455
1522
edit
Johann
Reuchlin
was
the
most
important
aspect
of
world
culture
teaching
within
Germany
at
this
time
He
was
a
scholar
of
both
Greek
and
Hebrew
Graduating
then
going
on
to
teach
at
Basel
he
was
considered
extremely
intelligent
Yet
after
leaving
Basel
he
had
to
start
copying
manuscripts
and
apprenticing
within
areas
of
law
However
he
is
most
known
for
his
work
within
Hebrew
studies
Unlike
some
other
thinkers
of
this
time
Reuchlin
submerged
himself
into
this
even
creating
a
guide
to
preaching
within
the
Hebrew
faith
The
book
titled
De
Arte
Predicandi
1503
is
possibly
one
of
his
best
known
works
from
this
period
Albrecht

Albrecht
D
rer
was
at
the
time
and
remains
the
most
famous
artist
of
the
German
Renaissance
He
was
famous
across
Europe
and
greatly
admired
in
Italy
where
his
work
was
mainly
known
through
his
prints
He
successfully
integrated
an
elaborate
Northern
style
with
Renaissance
harmony
and
monumentality
Among
his
best
known
works
are
Melencolia
I
the
Four
Horsemen
from
his
woodcut
Apocalypse
series
and
Death
the
Knight
and
the
Devil
Other
significant
artists
were
Lucas

the
Danube
School
and
the
Little

Martin
Luther
1483
1546
edit
Martin
Luther
11
initiated
the
Protestant
Reformation
through
the
criticisms
of
church
practices
such
as
selling
indulgences
which
he
published
in
his
Ninety
Five
Theses
of
1517
Luther
also
translated
the
Bible
into
German
making
the
Christian
scriptures
more

The
Reformation
also
referred
to
as
the
Protestant
Reformation
was
a
schism
from
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
initiated
by
Martin
Luther
and
continued
by
John
Calvin
Huldrych
Zwingli
and
other
early
Protestant
Reformers
in
16th
century
Europe
It
is
usually
considered
to
have
started
with
the
publication
of
the
Ninety
five
Theses
by
Luther
in
1517
and
lasting
until
the
end
of
the
Thirty
Years
War
with
the
Peace
of
Westphalia
in
1648
Although
there
had
been
significant
earlier
attempts
to
reform
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
before
Luther
such
as
those
of
Jan
Hus
Peter
Waldo
and
John
Wycliffe
Martin
Luther
is
widely
acknowledged
to
have
started
the
Reformation
with
the
Ninety
five
Theses
Luther
began
by
criticizing
the
sale
of
indulgences
insisting
that
the
Pope
had
no
authority
over
purgatory
and
that
the
Catholic
doctrine
of
the
merits
of
the
saints
had
no
foundation
in
the
Bible
The
Protestant
position
however
would
come
to
incorporate
doctrinal
changes
such
as
a
complete
reliance
on
Scripture
as
a
source
of
religious
authority
sola
scriptura
and
the
belief
that
faith
in
Jesus
and
not
good
works
is
the
only
way
to
obtain
God
s
pardon
for
sin
sola
fide
The
core
motivation
behind
these
changes
was
theological
though
many
other
factors
played
a
part
including
the
rise
of
nationalism
the
Western
Schism
that
eroded
faith
in
the
Papacy
the
perceived
corruption
of
the
Roman
Curia
the
impact
of
humanism
and
the
new
learning
of
the
Renaissance
that
questioned
much
traditional
thought
The
initial
movement
within
Germany
diversified
and
other
reform
impulses
arose
independently
of
Luther
The
spread
of
Gutenberg
s
printing
press
provided
the
means
for
the
rapid
dissemination
of
religious
materials
in
the
vernacular
The
largest
groups
were
the
Lutherans
and
Calvinists
Lutheran
churches
were
founded
mostly
in
Germany
the
Baltics
and
Scandinavia
while
the
Reformed
ones
were
founded
in
Switzerland
Hungary
France
the
Netherlands
and
Scotland
The
new
movement
influenced
the
Church
of
England
decisively
after
1547
under
Edward
VI
and
Elizabeth
I
although
the
Church
of
England
had
been
made
independent
under
Henry
VIII
in
the
early
1530s
There
were
also
reformation
movements
throughout
continental
Europe
known
as
the
Radical
Reformation
which
gave
rise
to
the
Anabaptist
Moravian
and
other
Pietistic
movements
Radical
Reformers
besides
forming
communities
outside
state
sanction
often
employed
more
extreme
doctrinal
change
such
as
the
rejection
of
the
tenets
of
the
late
antique
councils
of
Nicaea
and
Chalcedon
The
Roman
Catholic
Church
responded
with
a
Counter
Reformation
initiated
by
the
Council
of
Trent
Much
work
in
battling
Protestantism
was
done
by
the
well
organised
new
order
of
the
Jesuits
In
general
Northern
Europe
with
the
exception
of
most
of
Ireland
came
under
the
influence
of
Protestantism
Southern
Europe
remained
Roman
Catholic
while
Central
Europe
was
a
site
of
a
fierce
conflict
culminating
in
the
Thirty
Years
War
which
left
it
devastated

History
of
Protestantism
The
oldest
Protestant
churches
such
as
the
Unitas
Fratrum
and
Moravian
Church
date
their
origins
to
Jan
Hus
John
Huss
in
the
early
15th
century
As
it
was
led
by
a
Bohemian
noble
majority
and
recognised
for
a
time
by
the
Basel
Compacts
the
Hussite
Reformation
was
Europe
s
first
Magisterial
Reformation
because
the
ruling
magistrates
supported
it
unlike
the
Radical
Reformation
which
the
state
did
not
support
The
later
Protestant
Churches
generally
date
their
doctrinal
separation
from
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
to
the
16th
century
The
Reformation
began
as
an
attempt
to
reform
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
by
priests
who
opposed
what
they
perceived
as
false
doctrines
and
ecclesiastic
malpractice
They
especially
objected
to
the
teaching
and
the
sale
of
indulgences
and
the
abuses
thereof
and
to
simony
the
selling
and
buying
of
clerical
offices
The
reformers
saw
these
practices
as
evidence
of
the
systemic
corruption
of
the
Church
s
hierarchy
which
included
the
pope

in
Germany
edit
Martin
Luther
shown
in
a
portrait
by
Lucas
Cranach
the
Elder
initiated
the
Protestant
Reformation
in
1517
The
Reformation
is
often
dated
to
31
October
1517
in
Wittenberg
Saxony
when
Luther
sent
his
Ninety
Five
Theses
on
the
Power
and
Efficacy
of
Indulgences
to
the
Archbishop
of
Mainz
The
theses
debated
and
criticised
the
Church
and
the
papacy
but
concentrated
upon
the
selling
of
indulgences
and
doctrinal
policies
about
purgatory
particular
judgment
and
the
authority
of
the
pope
He
would
later
in
the
period
1517
1521
write
works
on
the
Catholic
devotion
to
Virgin
Mary
the
intercession
of
and
devotion
to
the
saints
the
sacraments
mandatory
clerical
celibacy
monasticism
further
on
the
authority
of
the
pope
the
ecclesiastical
law
censure
and
excommunication
the
role
of
secular
rulers
in
religious
matters
the
relationship
between
Christianity
and
the
law
and
good
works
8
Reformers
made
heavy
use
of
inexpensive
pamphlets
as
well
as
vernacular
Bibles
using
the
relatively
new
printing
press
so
there
was
swift
movement
of
both
ideas
and

Magisterial
Reformation
edit
Main
article
Magisterial
Reformation
Parallel
to
events
in
Germany
a
movement
began
in
Switzerland
under
the
leadership
of
Ulrich
Zwingli
These
two
movements
quickly
agreed
on
most
issues
but
some
unresolved
differences
kept
them
separate
Some
followers
of
Zwingli
believed
that
the
Reformation
was
too
conservative
and
moved
independently
toward
more
radical
positions
some
of
which
survive
among
modern
day
Anabaptists
Other
Protestant
movements
grew
up
along
lines
of
mysticism
or
humanism
sometimes
breaking
from
Rome
or
from
the
Protestants
or
forming
outside
of
the
churches
Martin
Luther
s
Ninety
five
Theses
placed
in
doubt
and
repudiated
several
of
the
Roman
Catholic
practices
After
this
first
stage
of
the
Reformation
following
the
excommunication
of
Luther
and
condemnation
of
the
Reformation
by
the
Pope
the
work
and
writings
of
John
Calvin
were
influential
in
establishing
a
loose
consensus
among
various
groups
in
Switzerland
Scotland
Hungary
Germany
and
elsewhere
The
Reformation
foundations
engaged
with
Augustinianism
both
Luther
and
Calvin
thought
along
lines
linked
with
the
theological
teachings
of
Augustine
of
Hippo
citation
needed
The
Augustinianism
of
the
reformers
struggled
against
Pelagianism
a
heresy
that
they
perceived
in
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
In
the
course
of
this
religious
upheaval
the
German
Peasants
War
of
1524
1525
swept
through
the
Bavarian
Thuringian
and
Swabian
principalities
including
the
Black
Company
of
Florian
Geier
a
knight
from
Giebelstadt
who
joined
the
peasants
in
the
general
outrage
against
the
Roman
Catholic
hierarchy
Zwinglian
and
Lutheran
ideas
had
influence
with
preachers
within
the
regions
that
the
Peasants
War
occurred
and
upon
works
such
as
the
Twelve
Articles
11
Luther
however
condemned
the
revolt
in
writings
such
as
Against
the
Murderous
Thieving
Hordes
of
Peasants
Zwingli
and
Luther
s
ally
Philipp
Melanchthon
also
did
not
condone
the
uprising

Some
100

peasants
were
killed

the

Radical
Reformation
edit
Main
article
Radical
Reformation
The
Radical
Reformation
was
the
response
to
what
was
believed
to
be
the
corruption
in
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
and
the
expanding
Magisterial
Protestant
movement
led
by
Martin
Luther
and
many
others
Beginning
in
Germany
and
Switzerland
in
the
16th
century
the
Radical
Reformation
gave
birth
to
many
radical
Protestant
groups
throughout
Europe
The
term
covers
both
radical
reformers
like
Thomas
M
ntzer
Andreas
Karlstadt
groups
like
the
Zwickau
prophets
and
Anabaptist
groups
like
the
Hutterites
and
Mennonites
In
parts
of
Germany
Switzerland
and
Austria
a
majority
sympathized
with
the
Radical
Reformation
despite
intense
persecution
15
Although
the
surviving
proportion
of
the
European
population
that
rebelled
against
Catholic
Lutheran
and
Zwinglian
churches
was
small
Radical
Reformers
wrote
profusely
and
the
literature
on
the
Radical
Reformation
is
disproportionately
large
partly
as
a
result
of
the
proliferation
of
the
Radical
Reformation
teachings
in
the
United
States

Literacy
edit
Martin
Luther
s
1534
Bible
translated
into
German
Luther
s
translation
influenced
the
development
of
the
current
Standard
German
The
Reformation
was
a
triumph
of
literacy
and
the
new
printing
press
17
a
9
19
Luther
s
translation
of
the
Bible
into
German
was
a
decisive
moment
in
the
spread
of
literacy
and
stimulated
as
well
the
printing
and
distribution
of
religious
books
and
pamphlets
From
1517
onward
religious
pamphlets
flooded
Germany
and
much
of
Europe
20
b
By
1530
over
10
000
publications
are
known
with
a
total
of
ten
million
copies
The
Reformation
was
thus
a
media
revolution
Luther
strengthened
his
attacks
on
Rome
by
depicting
a
good
against
bad
church
From
there
it
became
clear
that
print
could
be
used
for
propaganda
in
the
Reformation
for
particular
agendas
Reform
writers
used
pre
Reformation
styles
clich
s
and
stereotypes
and
changed
items
as
needed
for
their
own
purposes
20
Especially
effective
were
writings
in
German
including
Luther
s
translation
of
the
Bible
his
Smaller
Catechism
for
parents
teaching
their
children
and
his
Larger
Catechism
for
pastors
Using
the
German
vernacular
they
expressed
the
Apostles
Creed
in
simpler
more
personal
Trinitarian
language
Illustrations
in
the
German
Bible
and
in
many
tracts
popularised
Luther
s
ideas
Lucas
Cranach
the
Elder
1472
1553
the
great
painter
patronised
by
the
electors
of
Wittenberg
was
a
close
friend
of
Luther
and
he
illustrated
Luther
s
theology
for
a
popular
audience
He
dramatised
Luther
s
views
on
the
relationship
between
the
Old
and
New
Testaments
while
remaining
mindful
of
Luther
s
careful
distinctions
about
proper
and
improper
uses
of
visual
imagery

In

the

and

had
a

Huldrych

Huldrych
Zwingli
launched
the
Reformation
in
Switzerland
Parallel
to
events
in
Germany
a
movement
began
in
the
Swiss
Confederation
under
the
leadership
of
Huldrych
Zwingli
Zwingli
was
a
scholar
and
preacher
who
moved
to
Zurich
the
then
leading
city
state
in
1518
a
year
after
Martin
Luther
began
the
Reformation
in
Germany
with
his
Ninety
five
Theses
Although
the
two
movements
agreed
on
many
issues
of
theology
as
the
recently
introduced
printing
press
spread
ideas
rapidly
from
place
to
place
some
unresolved
differences
kept
them
separate
Long
standing
resentment
between
the
German
states
and
the
Swiss
Confederation
led
to
heated
debate
over
how
much
Zwingli
owed
his
ideas
to
Lutheranism
Although
Zwinglianism
does
hold
uncanny
resemblance
to
Lutheranism
it
even
had
its
own
equivalent
of
the
Ninety
five
Theses
called
the
67
Conclusions
historians
have
been
unable
to
prove
that
Zwingli
had
any
contact
with
Luther
s
publications
before
1520
and
Zwingli
himself
maintained
that
he
had
prevented
himself
from
reading
them
The
German
Prince
Philip
of
Hesse
saw
potential
in
creating
an
alliance
between
Zwingli
and
Luther
seeing
strength
in
a
united
Protestant
front
A
meeting
was
held
in
his
castle
in
1529
now
known
as
the
Colloquy
of
Marburg
which
has
become
infamous
for
its
complete
failure
The
two
men
could
not
come
to
any
agreement
due
to
their
disputation
over
one
key
doctrine
Although
Luther
preached
consubstantiation
in
the
Eucharist
over
transubstantiation
he
believed
in
the
spiritual
presence
of
Christ
at
the
Mass
Zwingli
inspired
by
Dutch
theologian
Cornelius
Hoen
believed
that
the
mass
was
only
representative
and
memorial
Christ
was
not
present
30
Luther
became
so
angry
that
he
famously
carved
into
the
meeting
table
in
chalk
Hoc
Est
Corpus
Meum
a
Biblical
quotation
from
the
Last
Supper
meaning
This
is
my
body
Zwingli
countered
this
saying
that
est
in
that
context
was
the
equivalent
of
the
word
significant
signifies
31
Some
followers
of
Zwingli
believed
that
the
Reformation
was
too
conservative
and
moved
independently
toward
more
radical
positions
some
of
which
survive
among
modern
day
Anabaptists

famous

this
was

John
Calvin
edit

John
Calvin
John
Calvin
was
one
of
the
leading
figures
of
the
Protestant
Reformation
His
legacy
remains
in
a
variety
of
churches
Following
the
excommunication
of
Luther
and
condemnation
of
the
Reformation
by
the
Pope
the
work
and
writings
of
John
Calvin
were
influential
in
establishing
a
loose
consensus
among
various
groups
in
Switzerland
Scotland
Hungary
Germany
and
elsewhere
After
the
expulsion
of
its
Bishop
in
1526
and
the
unsuccessful
attempts
of
the
Berne
reformer
Guillaume
William
Farel
Calvin
was
asked
to
use
the
organisational
skill
he
had
gathered
as
a
student
of
law
to
discipline
the
fallen
city
of
Geneva
His
Ordinances
of
1541
involved
a
collaboration
of
Church
affairs
with
the
City
council
and
consistory
to
bring
morality
to
all
areas
of
life
After
the
establishment
of
the
Geneva
academy
in
1559
Geneva
became
the
unofficial
capital
of
the
Protestant
movement
providing
refuge
for
Protestant
exiles
from
all
over
Europe
and
educating
them
as
Calvinist
missionaries
These
missionaries
dispersed
Calvinism
widely
and
formed
the
French
Huguenots
in
Calvin
s
own
lifetime
as
well
as
causing
the
conversion
of
Scotland
under
the
leadership
of
the
cantankerous
John
Knox
in
1560
The
faith
continued
to
spread
after
Calvin
s
death
in
1563
and
reached
as
far
as
Constantinople
by
the
start
of
the
17th
century
The
Reformation
foundations
engaged
with
Augustinianism
Both
Luther
and
Calvin
thought
along
lines
linked
with
the
theological
teachings
of
Augustine
of
Hippo
The
Augustinianism
of
the
Reformers
struggled
against
Pelagianism
a
heresy
that
they
perceived
in
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
of
their
day
Unfortunately
since
Calvin
and
Luther
disagreed
strongly
on
certain
matters
of
theology
such
as
double
predestination
and
Holy
Communion
the
relationship
between
Lutherans
and
Calvinists
was

The

Church
of
England
or
Anglican
Church
from
Rome
under
Henry
VIII
beginning
in
1529
and
completed
in

brought
England
alongside
this
broad
Reformation
movement
however
religious
changes
in
the
English
national
church
proceeded
more
conservatively
than
elsewhere
in
Europe
Reformers
in
the
Church
of
England
alternated
for
decades
between
sympathies
for
ancient
Catholic
tradition
and
more
Reformed
principles
gradually
developing
within
the
context
of
robustly
Protestant
doctrine
a
tradition
considered
a
middle
way
via
media
between
the
Roman
Catholic
and
Protestant
traditions
The
English
Reformation
followed
a
different
course
from
the
Reformation
in
continental
Europe
There
had
long
been
a
strong
strain
of
anti
clericalism
England
had
already
given
rise
to
the
Lollard
movement
of
John
Wycliffe
which
played
an
important
part
in
inspiring
the
Hussites
in
Bohemia
Lollardy
was
suppressed
and
became
an
underground
movement
so
the
extent
of
its
influence
in
the
1520s
is
difficult
to
assess
The
different
character
of
the
English
Reformation
came
rather
from
the
fact
that
it
was
driven
initially
by
the
political
necessities
of
Henry
VIII
Henry
had
once
been
a
sincere
Roman
Catholic
and
had
even
authored
a
book
strongly
criticising
Luther
His
wife
Catherine
of
Aragon
bore
him
only
a
single
child
that
survived
infancy
Mary
Henry
strongly
wanted
a
male
heir
and
many
of
his
subjects
might
have
agreed
if
only
because
they
wanted
to
avoid
another
dynastic
conflict
like
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
Thomas
Cranmer
proved
essential
in
the
development
of
the
English
Reformation
King
Henry
decided
to
remove
the
Church
of
England
from
the
authority
of
Rome
In
1534
the
Act
of
Supremacy
recognized
Henry
as
the
only
Supreme
Head
on
earth
of
the
Church
of
England
34
Between
1535
and
1540
under
Thomas
Cromwell
the
policy
known
as
the
Dissolution
of
the
Monasteries
was
put
into
effect
The
veneration
of
some
saints
certain
pilgrimages
and
some
pilgrim
shrines
were
also
attacked
Huge
amounts
of
church
land
and
property
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
Crown
and
ultimately
into
those
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
The
vested
interest
thus
created
made
for
a
powerful
force
in
support
of
the
dissolutions
There
were
some
notable
opponents
to
the
Henrician
Reformation
such
as
Thomas
More
and
Bishop
John
Fisher
who
were
executed
for
their
opposition
There
was
also
a
growing
party
of
reformers
who
were
imbued
with
the
Calvinistic
Lutheran
and
Zwinglian
doctrines
now
current
on
the
Continent
When
Henry
died
he
was
succeeded
by
his
Protestant
son
Edward
VI
who
through
his
empowered
councillors
with
the
King
being
only
nine
years
old
at
his
succession
and
fifteen
at
his
death
the
Duke
of
Somerset
and
the
Duke
of
Northumberland
ordered
the
destruction
of
images
in
churches
and
the
closing
of
the
chantries
Under
Edward
VI
the
Church
of
England
moved
closer
to
continental
Protestantism
Yet
at
a
popular
level
religion
in
England
was
still
in
a
state
of
flux
Following
a
brief
Roman
Catholic
restoration
during
the
reign
of
Mary
1553
1558
a
loose
consensus
developed
during
the
reign
of
Elizabeth
I
though
this
point
is
one
of
considerable
debate
among
historians
This
Elizabethan
Religious
Settlement
largely
formed
Anglicanism
into
a
distinctive
church
tradition
The
compromise
was
uneasy
and
was
capable
of
veering
between
extreme
Calvinism
on
one
hand
and
Roman
Catholicism
on
the
other
But
compared
to
the
bloody
and
chaotic
state
of
affairs
in
contemporary
France
it
was
relatively
successful
in
part
because
Queen
Elizabeth

17th
centuries
was
Reformed
or
Calvinist
and
was
a
movement
for
reform
in
the
Church
of
England
Its
origins
lay
in
the
discontent
with
the
Elizabethan
Religious
Settlement
The
desire
was
for
the
Church
of
England
to
resemble
more
closely
the
Protestant
churches
of
Europe
especially
Geneva
The
Puritans
objected
to
ornaments
and
ritual
in
the
churches
as
idolatrous
vestments
surplices
organs
genuflection
which
they
castigated
as
popish
pomp
and
rags
See
Vestments
controversy
They
also
objected
to
ecclesiastical
courts
Their
refusal
to
endorse
completely
all
of
the
ritual
directions
and
formulas
of
the
Book
of
Common
Prayer
and
the
imposition
of
its
liturgical
order
by
legal
force
and
inspection
sharpened
Puritanism
into
a
definite
opposition
movement
The
later
Puritan
movement
often
referred
to
as
dissenters
and
nonconformists
eventually
led
to
the
formation
of
various
reformed
denominations
The
most
famous
emigration
to
America
was
the
migration
of
Puritan
separatists
from
the
Anglican
Church
of
England
They
fled
first
to
Holland
and
then
later
to
America
to
establish
the
English
colony
of
Massachusetts
in
New
England
which
later
became
one
of
the
original
United
States
These
Puritan
separatists
were
also
known
as
the
Pilgrims
After
establishing
a
colony
at
Plymouth
which
became
part
of
the
colony
of
Massachusetts
in
1620
the
Puritan
pilgrims
received
a
charter
from
the
King
of
England
that
legitimised
their
colony
allowing
them
to
do
trade
and
commerce
with
merchants
in
England
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
mercantilism
The
Puritans
persecuted
those
of
other
religious
faiths
37
Quaker
Mary
Dyer
was
hanged
in
Boston
for
repeatedly
defying
a
Puritan
law
banning
Quakers
from
the
colony
38
She
was
one
of
the
four
executed
Quakers
known
as
the
Boston
martyrs
Executions
ceased
in
1661
when
King
Charles
II
explicitly
forbade
Massachusetts
from
executing
anyone
for
professing
Quakerism
39
In
1647
Massachusetts
passed
a
law
prohibiting
any
Jesuit
Roman
Catholic
priests
from
entering
territory
under
Puritan
jurisdiction
40
Any
suspected
person
who
could
not
clear
himself
was
to
be
banished
from
the
colony
a
second
offense
carried
a
death
penalty
41
The
Pilgrims
held
radical
Protestant
disapproval
of
Christmas
and
its
celebration
was
outlawed
in
Boston
from
1659
to
1681
42
The
ban
was
revoked
in
1681
by
the
English
appointed
governor
Edmund
Andros
who
also
revoked
a
Puritan
ban
on
festivities
on
Saturday
nights
42
Nevertheless
it
was
not
until
the
mid
19th
century
that
celebrating
Christmas
became
fashionable
in
the
Boston
region

forbade
the

saw
a

Presbyterianism
particularly
the
Covenanters

eventually
won
control
of
the
Church
of

Although

allied
France
with
Protestant
states
Protestantism
also
spread
from
the
German
lands
into
France
where
the
Protestants
were
nicknamed
Huguenots
this
eventually
led
to
decades
of
civil
warfare
Though
not
personally
interested
in
religious
reform
Francis
I
reigned
1515
1547
initially
maintained
an
attitude
of
tolerance
in
accordance
with
his
interest
in
the
humanist
movement
This
changed
in
1534
with
the
Affair
of
the
Placards
In
this
act
Protestants
denounced
the
Catholic
Mass
in
placards
that
appeared
across
France
even
reaching
the
royal
apartments
The
issue
of
religious
faith
having
been
thrown
into
the
arena
of
politics
Francis
came
to
view
the
movement
as
a
threat
to
the
kingdom
s
stability
This
led
to
the
first
major
phase
of
anti
Protestant
persecution
in
France
in
which
the
Chambre
Ardente
Burning
Chamber
was
established
1535
within
the
Parlement
of
Paris
to
deal
with
the
rise
in
prosecutions
for
heresy
Several
thousand
French
Protestants
fled
the
country
most
notably
John
Calvin
who
emigrated
to
Basel
in
1535
before
eventually
settling
in
Geneva
in
1536
Calvin
continued
to
take
an
interest
in
the
religious
affairs
of
his
native
land
and
from
his
base
in

the

came
to
acquire
a
distinctly
political
character
made
all
the
more
obvious
by
the
conversions
of
nobles
during
the
1550s
This
established
the
preconditions
for
a
series
of
destructive
and
intermittent
conflicts
known
as
the
Wars
of
Religion
The
civil
wars
gained
impetus
with
the
sudden
death
of
Henry
II
in
1559
which
began
a
prolonged
period
of
weakness
for
the
French
crown
Atrocity
and
outrage
became
the
defining
characteristics
of
the
time
illustrated
at
their
most
intense
in
the
St
Bartholomew
s
Day
massacre
of

1572
when
the
Roman
Catholic
party
annihilated
between
30
000
and
100
000
Huguenots
across
France
The
wars
only
concluded
when
Henry
IV
himself
a
former
Huguenot
issued
the
Edict
of
Nantes
1598
promising
official
toleration
of
the
Protestant
minority
but
under
highly
restricted
conditions
Roman
Catholicism
remained
the
official
state
religion
and
the
fortunes
of
French
Protestants
gradually
declined
over
the
next
century
culminating
in
Louis
XIV
s
Edict
of
Fontainebleau
1685
which
revoked
the
Edict
of
Nantes
and
made
Roman
Catholicism
the
sole
legal
religion
of
France
In

Frederick
William

clandestinely
and
in

Mary
I
of

the
first
Plantations
of
Ireland
which
ironically
soon
came
to
be
associated
with

The
Reformation
in
Ireland
was
a
movement
for
the
reform
of
religious
life
and
institutions
that
was
introduced
into
Ireland
by
the
English
administration
at
the
behest
of
King
Henry
VIII
of
England
His
desire
for
an
annulment
of
his
marriage
was
known
as
the
King
s
Great
Matter
Ultimately
Pope
Clement
VII
refused
the
petition
consequently
it
became
necessary
for
the
King
to
assert
his
lordship
over
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
in
his
realm
to
give
legal
effect
to
his
wishes
The
English
Parliament
confirmed
the
King
s
supremacy
over
the
Church
in
the
Kingdom
of
England
This
challenge
to
Papal
supremacy
resulted
in
a
breach
with
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
By
1541
the
Irish
Parliament
had
agreed
to
the
change
in
status
of
the
country
from
that
of
a
Lordship
to
that
of
Kingdom
of
Ireland
Unlike
similar
movements
for
religious
reform
on
the
continent
of
Europe
the
various
phases
of
the
English
Reformation
as
it
developed
in
Ireland
were
largely
driven
by
changes
in
government
policy
to
which
public
opinion
in
England
gradually
accommodated
itself
However
a
number
of
factors
complicated
the
adoption
of
the
religious
innovations
in
Ireland
the
majority
of
the
population
there
adhered
to
the

English
Reformation
In
the
first
half
of
the
16th

the
enormous
Polish
Lithuanian
Commonwealth
was
a
country
of
many
creeds
but
Roman

Poland
in
the
1520s

The
Duchy

Prussia
which
was
a

center
of
the
movement
with
numerous
publishing
houses
issuing
not

also
catechisms
in
German
Polish

Lutheranism
gained
popularity
in

Calvinism
caught
the
interest

nobility
known
as

mainly
in
Lesser

and
the
Grand
Duchy

Several
publishing

were
opened
in
Lesser

in
the
mid
16th
century
in
such
locations
as

At
that
time
Mennonites

Czech
Brothers
came
to
Poland
with
the
latter
settling
mostly
in
Greater
Poland

Leszno
In
1565
the
Polish
Brethren
appeared
as
yet
another
reformation
movement
The
Commonwealth
was
unique
in
Europe
in
the
16th
century
for
its
widespread
tolerance
confirmed
by
the
Warsaw
Confederation
In
1563
the
Brest
Bible
was
published

period

during
the
reign

was
under

strong
influence
of
Piotr

the
mid
17th
century
in
which
all
enemies

the

attitude
changed

in

the
Polish
Brethren
were
forced
to
leave
the
country
and
in
1666
the
Sejm
banned
apostasy
from
Catholicism
to
any
other
religion

Primo

is
notable
for
consolidating
the

language
and
is
considered
to
be
the
key
figure
of
Slovenian
cultural
history
and
in
many
aspects
a
major
Slovene
historical
personality
50
He
was
the
key
figure
of
the
Protestant
Church
of
the
Slovene
Lands
as
he
was
its
founder
and
its
first
superintendent

partially
Lutheran
Greece

The
Protestant
teachings
of
the
Western
Church
were
also
briefly
adopted
within
the
Eastern
Orthodox
Church
through
the
Greek
Patriarch
Cyril
Lucaris
in
1629
with
the
publishing
of
the
Confessio
Calvinistic
doctrine
in
Geneva
Motivating
factors
in
their
decision
to
adopt
aspects
of
the
Reformation
included
the
historical
rivalry
and
mistrust
between
the
Greek
Orthodox
and
Roman
Catholic
church
along
with
their
concerns
of
Jesuit
priests
entering
Greek
lands
in
their
attempts
to
propagate
the
teachings
of
the
Counter
Reformation
to
the
Greek
populace
He
subsequently
sponsored
Maximos
of
Gallipoli
s
translation
of
the
New
Testament
into
the
Modern
Greek
language
and
was
published
in
Geneva
in
1638
Upon
Lucaris
s
death
in
1638
the
conservative
factions
within
the
Eastern
Orthodox
Church
held
two
synods
the
Synod
of
Constantinople
1638
and
Synod
of
Jassy
1642
criticizing
the
reforms
and
in
the
1672
convocation
led
by
Dositheos
they
officially
condemned
the
Calvinistic
doctrines
Spread
edit
The
Reformation
spread
throughout
Europe
beginning
in
1517
reaching
its
peak
between
1545
and
1620
and
ending
in
1648
At
its
peak
edit
The
high
point
of
the
Protestant
Reformation
occured
at
some
point
between
1545
and
1620
In
1545
it
was
first
considered
a
serious
threat
to
the
Catholic
Church
and
the
Papacy
at
the
Council
of
Trent
prompting
counterreformational
measures
by
Catholic
religious
hierarchy
In
1620
the
Battle
of
White
Mountain
put
an
end
to
Protestantism
in
Bohemia
now
the
Czech
Republic
The
Thirty
Years
War
began
in
1618
and
brought
a
drastic
territorial
and
demographic
decline
when
the
House
of
Habsburg
introduced
counterreformational
measures
throughout
their
vast
possessions
in
Central
Europe
The
Protestant
Reformation
at
its
peak
superimposed
on
modern
European
borders
At
its
end
edit
In
1545
the
Council
of
Trent
officially
launched
the
Counter
Reformation
against
Protestantism
in
Europe
to
restore
unity
in
the
Catholic
Church
This
effort
concluded
in
1648
as
did
the
Protestant
Reformation
itself
Common
historical
consensus
holds
that
the
Protestant
Reformation
and
the
Counter
Reformation
both
ended
in
1648
when
the
Thirty
Years
War
concluded
with
the
Peace
of
Westphalia

Protestant

Counter

their
end

Conclusion
and
legacy
edit
End
of
the
Reformation
edit
There
is
no
universal
agreement
on
the
exact
or
approximate
date
the
Protestant
Reformation
ended
Various
interpretations
emphasize
different
dates
entire
periods
or
argue
that
the
Reformation
never
really
ended
However
there
are
a
few
popular
interpretations
that
are
used
by
large
groups
of
observers
Historically
the
Peace
of
Westphalia
is
considered
to
be
the
event
that
ended
the
Reformation
This
is
the
most
commonly
held
interpretation
According
to
other
historical
interpretation
the
Reformation
could
truly
be
considered
to
have
ended
in
the
middle
18th
century
as
the
Peace
of
Westphalia
did
not
specify
nor
did
it
mean
that
it
concluded
that
is
around
time
the
First
Great
Awakening
1730
1755
took
place
People
who
hold
this
interpretation
often
argue
that
the
emergence
of
Pietism
prolonged
the
Reformation
up
to
this
point
Some
argue
that
the
Reformation
never
ended
as
new
groups
have
splintered
from
the
Catholic
Church
e
g
Old
Catholics
Polish
National
Catholic
Church
etc
as
well
as
all
the
various
Protestant
churches
that
exist
today
No
group
splintering
from
the
Catholic
Church
since
the
17th
century
has
done
so
on
the
basis
of
the
same
issues
animating
the
Protestant
Reformation

Historiography
edit
Margaret
C
Jacob
argues
that
there
has
been
a
dramatic
shift
in
the
historiography
of
the
Reformation
Until
the
1960s
historians
focused
their
attention
largely
on
the
great
leaders
and
theologians
of
the
16th
century
especially
Luther
Calvin
and
Zwingli
Their
ideas
were
studied
in
depth
However
the
rise
of
the
new
social
history
in
the
1960s
look
at
history
from
the
bottom
up
not
from
the
top
down
Historians
began
to
concentrate
on
the
values
beliefs
and
behavior
of
the
people
at
large
She
finds
in
contemporary
scholarship
the
Reformation
is
now
seen
as
a
vast
cultural
upheaval
a
social
and
popular
movement
textured
and
rich
because
of
its
diversity

In
the
end
while
the
Reformation
emphasis
on
Protestants
reading
the
Scriptures
was
one
factor
in
the
development
of
literacy
the
impact
of
printing
itself
the
wider
availability
of
printed
works
at
a
cheaper
price
and
the
increasing
focus
on
education
and
learning
as
key
factors
in
obtaining
a
lucrative
post
were
also
significant
contributory
factors
18
In
the
first
decade
of
the
Reformation
Luther
s
message
became
a
movement
and
the
output
of
religious
pamphlets
in
Germany
was
at
its
height

Lutheranism
is
a
major
branch
of
Protestant
Christianity
which
identifies
with
the
theology
of
Martin
Luther
1483
1546
a
German
friar
ecclesiastical
reformer
and
theologian
Luther
s
efforts
to
reform
the
theology
and
practice
of
the
Catholic
Church
launched
the
Protestant
Reformation
in
the
German
speaking
territories
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
Beginning
with
the
Ninety
Five
Theses
first
published
in
1517
Luther
s
writings
were
disseminated
internationally
spreading
the
early
ideas
of
the
Reformation
beyond
the
influence
and
control
of
the
Roman
Curia
and
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
1
The
split
between
the
Lutherans
and
the
Catholics
was
made
public
and
clear
with
the
1521
Edict
of
Worms
the
edicts
of
the
Diet
condemned
Luther
and
officially
banned
citizens
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire

the
remaining
half

2
The
divide
centered
primarily
on
two
points
the
proper
source
of
authority
in
the
church
often
called
the
formal
principle
of
the
Reformation
and
the
doctrine
of
justification
often
called
the
material
principle
a
Lutheranism
advocates
a
doctrine
of
justification
by
grace
alone
through
faith
alone
on
the
basis
of
Scripture
alone
the
doctrine
that
scripture
is
the
final
authority
on
all
matters
of
faith
This
is
in
contrast
to
the
belief
of
the
Catholic
Church
defined
at
the
Council
of
Trent
concerning
authority
coming
from
both
the
Scriptures
and
Tradition
3
In
addition
Lutheranism
accepts
the
teachings
of
the
first
seven
ecumenical
councils
of
the
undivided
Christian
Church
4
5
The
Augsburg
Confession
a
Lutheran
statement
of
belief
contained
in
the
Book
of
Concord
teaches
that
the
faith
as
confessed
by
Luther
and
his
followers
is
nothing
new
but
the
true
catholic
faith
and
that
their
churches
represent
the
true
catholic
or
universal
church
6
When
the
Lutherans
presented
the
Augsburg
Confession
to
Charles
V
Holy
Roman
Emperor
they
believe
to
have
showed
that
each
article
of
faith
and
practice
was
true
first
of
all
to
Holy
Scripture
and
then
also
to
the
teaching
of
the
church
fathers
and
the
councils
6
Unlike
Calvinism
Lutherans
retain
many
of
the
liturgical
practices
and
sacramental
teachings
of
the
pre
Reformation
Church
with
a
particular
emphasis
on
the
Eucharist
or
Lord
s
Supper
Lutheran
theology
differs
from
Reformed
theology
in
Christology
the
purpose
of
God
s
Law
the
divine
grace
the
concept
of
perseverance
of
the
saints
and

Etymology
edit
Luther
s
rose
seal
a
symbol
of
Lutheranism
The
name
Lutheran
originated
as
a
derogatory
term
used
against
Luther
by
German
Scholastic
theologian
Dr
Johann
Maier
von
Eck
during
the
Leipzig
Debate
in
July
1519
10
Eck
and
other
Catholics
followed
the
traditional
practice
of
naming
a
heresy
after
its
leader
thus
labeling
all
who
identified
with
the
theology
of
Martin
Luther
as
Lutherans
2
Martin
Luther
always
disliked
the
term
Lutheran
preferring
the
term
Evangelical
which
was
derived
from
euangelion
a
Greek
word
meaning
good
news
i
e
Gospel
10
The
followers
of
John
Calvin
Huldrych
Zwingli
and
other
theologians
linked
to
the
Reformed
tradition
also
began
to
use
that
term
To
distinguish
the
two
evangelical
groups
others
began
to
refer
to
the
two
groups
as
Evangelical
Lutheran
and
Evangelical
Reformed
As
time
passed
by
the
word
Evangelical
was
dropped
Lutherans
themselves
began
to
use
the
term
Lutheran
in
the
middle
of
the
16th
century
in
order
to
distinguish
themselves
from
other
groups
such
as
the
Philippists
and
Calvinists
In
1597
theologians
in
Wittenberg
defined
the
title
Lutheran
as
referring
to
the
true
church

its
roots
in

the
monarch
of
Denmark
Norway
also
ruling
Iceland
and
the

adopted
Lutheranism
Through

German
and

rule
Lutheranism
also
spread
into
Estonia
and
Latvia
Since

regular
14
Lutheran
services
have
been
held
in
Copenhagen
Under
the
reign
of
Frederick
I
1523
33
Denmark
Norway
remained
officially
Catholic
Although
Frederick
initially
pledged
to
persecute
Lutherans
he
soon
adopted
a
policy
of
protecting
Lutheran
preachers
and
reformers
the
most
significant
being
Hans
Tausen
15
During
Frederick
s
reign
Lutheranism
made
significant
inroads
in
Denmark
At
an
open
meeting
in
Copenhagen
attended
by
the
king
in
1536
the
people
shouted
We
will
stand
by
the
holy
Gospel
and
do
not
want
such
bishops
anymore
16
Frederick
s
son
Christian
was
openly
Lutheran
which
prevented
his
election
to
the
throne
upon
his
father
s
death
However
following
his
victory
in
the
civil
war
that
followed
in

he
became

the
replacement
of
an
archbishop
who
had
supported
the
invading
forces
opposing

during

Stockholm
Bloodbath
led
to
the
severing
of
any
official
connection
between
Sweden
and
the
papacy
in
1523
15
Four

the
king
succeeded
in
forcing
the
diet
to
accept
his
dominion

king
was
given
possession
of
all
church
properties
as
well
as
the
church
appointments

of
the

effectively
granted

did
not

out
as

arose
was
the

25
Late

was
torn
by
influences
from
rationalism

Pietism
a
revival
movement
in
Lutheranism
After
a
century
of
vitality
the
Pietist
theologians
Philipp
Jakob
Spener
and
August
Hermann
Francke
warned
that
orthodoxy
had
degenerated
into
meaningless
intellectualism
and
Formalism
while
orthodox
theologians
found
the
emotional
and
subjective
focuses
of
Pietism
to

Rationalism
edit
Rationalist
philosophers
from
France
and
England
had
an
enormous
impact
during
the
18th
century
along
with
the
German
Rationalists
Christian
Wolff
Gottfried
Leibniz
and
Immanuel
Kant
Their
work
led
to
an
increase
in
rationalist
beliefs
at
the
expense
of
faith
in
God
and
agreement
with
the
Bible
26
In
1709
Valentin
Ernst
L
scher
warned
that
this
new
Rationalist
view
of
the
world
fundamentally
changed
society
by
drawing
into
question
every
aspect
of
theology
Instead
of
considering
the
authority
of
divine
revelation
he
explained
Rationalists
relied
solely
on
their
personal
understanding
when
searching
for
truth
27
Johann
Melchior
Goeze
1717
1786
pastor
of
St
Catherine
s
Church
Hamburg
wrote
apologetical
works
against
Rationalists
including
a
theological
and
historical
defence
against
the
historical
criticism
of
the
Bible
28
Dissenting
Lutheran
pastors
were
often
reprimanded
by
the
government
bureaucracy
overseeing
them
for
example
when
they
tried
to
correct
Rationalist
influences
in
the
parish
school
29
As
a
result
of
the
impact
of
a
local
form
of
rationalism
termed
Neology
by
the
latter
half
of
the
18th
century
genuine
piety
was
found
almost
solely
in
small
Pietist
conventicles
26
However
some
of
the
laity
preserved
Lutheran
orthodoxy
from
both
Pietism
and
rationalism
through
reusing
old
catechisms
hymnbooks
postils
and
devotional
writings

became
famous
for
countering
Rationalism
and
striving
to
advance
a
revival
known
as
the
Erweckung
or
Awakening
31
In
1806
Napoleon
s
invasion
of
Germany
promoted
Rationalism
and
angered
German
Lutherans
stirring
up
a
desire
among
the
people
to
preserve
Luther
s
theology
from
the
Rationalist
threat
Those
associated
with
this
Awakening
held
that
reason
was
insufficient
and
pointed
out
the
importance
of
emotional
religious
experiences
32
33
Small
groups
sprang
up
often
in
universities
which
devoted
themselves
to
Bible
study
reading
devotional
writings
and
revival
meetings
Although
the
beginning
of
this
Awakening
tended
heavily
toward
Romanticism
patriotism
and
experience
the
emphasis
of
the
Awakening
shifted
around
1830
to
restoring
the
traditional
liturgy
doctrine
and
confessions
of
the
Lutheran
church
in
the
Neo
Lutheran
movement
32

theologians
of
the
17th
century
and
opposed
modern
Bible
scholarship
42
As
editor
of
the
periodical
Evangelische
Kirchenzeitung
he
developed
it
into
a
major
support
of
Neo
Lutheran
revival
and
used
it
to
attack
all
forms
of
theological
liberalism
and
rationalism
Although
he
received
a
large
amount
of
slander
and
ridicule
during
his
forty
years
at
the
head
of
revival
he
never
gave
up
his
positions
41
The
theological
faculty
at
the
University
of
Erlangen
in
Bavaria
became
another
force
for
reform
41
There
professor
Adolf
von
Harless
though
previously
an
adherent
of
rationalism
and
German
idealism
made
Erlangen
a
magnet
for
revival
oriented
theologians
43
Termed
the
Erlangen
School
of
theology
they
developed
a
new
version
of
the
Incarnation
43
which
they
felt
emphasized
the
humanity
of
Jesus
better
than
the
ecumenical
creeds
44
As
theologians
they
used
both
modern
historical
critical
and
Hegelian
philosophical
methods
instead
of
attempting
to
revive
the
orthodoxy
of
the
17th
century
45
Friedrich
Julius
Stahl
led
the
High
Church
Lutherans
Though
raised
a
Jew
he
was
baptized
as
a
Christian
at
the
age
of
19
through
the
influence
of
the
Lutheran
school
he
attended
As
the
leader
of
a
neofeudal
Prussian
political
party
he
campaigned
for
the
divine
right
of
kings
the
power
of
the
nobility
and
episcopal
polity
for
the
church
Along
with
Theodor
Kliefoth
and
August
Friedrich
Christian
Vilmar
he
promoted
agreement
with
the
Catholic
Church
with
regard
to
the
authority
of
the
institutional
church
ex
opere
operato
effectiveness
of
the
sacraments
and
the
divine
authority
of
clergy
Unlike
Catholics
however
they
also
urged
complete
agreement
with
the
Book
of
Concord
44
The
Neo
Lutheran
movement
managed
to
slow
secularism
and
counter
atheistic
Marxism
but
it
did
not
fully
succeed
in
Europe
39
It
partly
succeeded
in
continuing
the
Pietist
movement
s
drive
to
right
social
wrongs
and
focus
on
individual
conversion
The
Neo
Lutheran
call
to
renewal
failed
to
achieve
widespread
popular
acceptance
because
it
both
began
and
continued
with
a
lofty
idealistic
Romanticism
that
did
not
connect
with
an
increasingly
industrialized
and
secularized
Europe
46
At
best
the
work
of
local
leaders
resulted
in
specific
areas
with
vibrant
spiritual
renewal
but
people
in
Lutheran
areas
overall
continued
to
become
increasingly
distant
from
church
life
39
By
1969
Manfried
Kober
complained
that
unbelief
is
rampant
even
within
German
Lutheran
parishes

of

Law
and
Grace

Lucas
Cranach
the
Elder
The
left
side
shows
humans
condemnation
under
God
s
law
while
the
right
side
presents
God
s
grace
in
Christ
Traditionally
Lutherans
hold
the
Bible
of
the
Old
and
New
Testaments
to
be
the
only
divinely
inspired
book
the
only
source
of
divinely
revealed
knowledge
and
the
only
norm
for
Christian
teaching
48
Scripture
alone
is
the
formal
principle
of
the
faith
the
final
authority
for
all
matters
of
faith
and
morals
because
of
its
inspiration
authority
clarity
efficacy
and
sufficiency
49
The
authority
of
the
Scriptures
has
been
challenged
during
the
history
of
Lutheranism
Martin
Luther
taught
that
the
Bible
was
the
written
Word
of
God
and
the
only
reliable
guide
for
faith
and
practice
He
held
that
every
passage
of
Scripture
has
one
straightforward
meaning
the
literal
sense
as
interpreted
by
other
Scripture
50
These
teachings
were
accepted
during
the
orthodox
Lutheranism
of
the
17th
century
51
During
the
18th
century
Rationalism
advocated
reason
rather
than
the
authority
of
the
Bible
as
the
final
source
of
knowledge
but
most
of
the
laity
did
not
accept
this
Rationalist
position
52
In
the
19th
century
a
confessional
revival
re
emphasized
the
authority
of
the
Bible
and
agreement
with
the
Lutheran
Confessions
Today
Lutherans
disagree
about
the
inspiration
and
authority
of
the
Bible
Theological
conservatives
use
the
historical
grammatical
method
of
Biblical
interpretation
while
theological
liberals
use
the
higher
critical
method
The
2008
U
S
Religious
Landscape
Survey
conducted
by
the
Pew
Research
Center
surveyed
1
926
adults
in
the
United
States

identified

The

found
that

believed
that
the

was
the
Word
of
God
and
was

the
Bible
was
the
Word

53
Inspiration
edit
Although
many
Lutherans
today
hold
less
specific
views
of
inspiration
historically
Lutherans
affirm
that
the
Bible
does
not
merely
contain
the
Word
of
God
but
every
word
of
it
is
because
of
plenary
verbal
inspiration
the
direct
immediate
word
of
God
54
The
Apology
of
the
Augsburg
Confession
identifies
Holy
Scripture
with
the
Word
of
God
55
and
calls
the
Holy
Spirit
the
author
of
the
Bible
56
Because
of
this
Lutherans
confess
in
the
Formula
of
Concord
we
receive
and
embrace
with
our
whole
heart
the
prophetic
and
apostolic
Scriptures
of
the
Old
and
New
Testaments
as
the
pure
clear
fountain
of
Israel
57
The
apocryphal
books
were
not
written
by
the
prophets
nor
by
inspiration
they
contain
errors
58
and
were
never
included
in
the
Judean
Canon
that
Jesus
used
59
therefore
they
are
not
a
part
of
Holy
Scripture
60
The
prophetic
and
apostolic
Scriptures
are
authentic
as
written
by
the
prophets
and
apostles
A
correct
translation
of
their
writings
is
God
s
Word
because
it
has
the
same
meaning
as
the
original
Hebrew
and
Greek
60
A
mistranslation
is
not
God
s
word
and
no
human
authority
can
invest
it
with
divine
authority

Historically
Lutherans
understand
the
Bible
to
present
all
doctrines
and
commands
of
the
Christian
faith
clearly
61
In
addition
Lutherans
believe
that
God
s
Word
is
freely
accessible
to
every
reader
or
hearer
of
ordinary
intelligence
without
requiring
any
special
education
62
A
Lutheran
must
understand
the
language
that
scriptures
are
presented
in
and
should
not
be
so
preoccupied
by
error
so
as
to
prevent
understanding
63
As
a
result
of
this
Lutherans
do
not
believe
there
is
a
need
to
wait
for
any
clergy
pope
scholar
or
ecumenical
council
to
explain
the
real
meaning
of
any
part
of
the
Bible
64
Efficacy
edit
Lutherans
confess
that
Scripture
is
united
with
the
power
of
the
Holy
Spirit
and
with
it
not
only
demands
but
also
creates
the
acceptance
of
its
teaching
65
This
teaching
produces
faith
and
obedience
Holy
Scripture
is
not
a
dead
letter
but
rather
the
power
of
the
Holy
Spirit
is
inherent
in
it
66
Scripture
does
not
compel
a
mere
intellectual
assent
to
its
doctrine
resting
on
logical
argumentation
but
rather
it
creates
the
living
agreement
of
faith
67
As
the
Smalcald
Articles
affirm
in
those
things
which
concern
the
spoken
outward
Word
we
must
firmly
hold
that
God
grants
His
Spirit
or
grace
to
no
one
except
through
or
with
the
preceding
outward
Word
68
Sufficiency
edit
Lutherans
are
confident
that
the
Bible
contains
everything
that
one
needs
to
know
in
order
to
obtain
salvation
and
to
live
a
Christian
life
69
There
are
no
deficiencies
in
Scripture
that
need
to
be
filled
with
by
tradition
pronouncements
of
the
Pope
new
revelations
or
present
day
development
of
doctrine
70
Law
and
Gospel
edit
Lutherans
understand
the
Bible
as
containing
two
distinct
types
of
content
termed
Law
and
Gospel
or
Law
and
Promises
71
Properly
distinguishing
between
Law
and
Gospel
prevents
the
obscuring
of
the
Gospel
teaching
of
justification
by
grace
through
faith
alone
72
Lutheran

Title
Page
from
the
1580
Dresden
Book
of
Concord
The
Book
of
Concord
published
in
1580
contains
ten
documents
which
some
Lutherans
believe
are
faithful
and
authoritative
explanations
of
Holy
Scripture
Besides
the
three
Ecumenical
Creeds
which
date
to
Roman
times
the
Book
of
Concord
contains
seven
credal
documents
articulating
Lutheran
theology
in
the
Reformation
era
The
doctrinal
positions
of
Lutheran
churches
are
not
uniform
because
the
Book
of
Concord
does
not
hold
the
same
position
in
all
Lutheran
churches
For
example
the
state
churches
in
Scandinavia
consider
only
the
Augsburg
Confession
as
a
summary
of
the
faith
in
addition
to
the
three
ecumenical
Creeds
73
Lutheran
pastors
congregations
and
church
bodies
in
Germany
and
the
Americas
usually
agree
to
teach
in
harmony
with
the
entire
Lutheran
Confessions
Some
Lutheran
church
bodies
require
this
pledge
to
be
unconditional
because
they
believe
the
confessions
correctly
state
what
the
Bible
teaches
Others
allow
their
congregations
to
do
so
insofar
as
the
Confessions
are
in
agreement
with
the
Bible
Justification
edit
Lutherans
believe
that
whoever
has
faith
in
Jesus
alone
will
receive
salvation
from
the
grace
of
God
and
will
enter
eternity
in
heaven
instead
of
eternity
in
hell
after
death
or
at
the
second
coming
of
Jesus
The
key
doctrine
or
material
principle
of
Lutheranism
is
the
doctrine
of
justification
Lutherans
believe
that
humans
are
saved
from
their
sins
by
God
s
grace
alone
Sola
Gratia
through
faith
alone
Sola
Fide
on
the
basis
of
Scripture
alone
Sola
Scriptura
Orthodox
Lutheran
theology
holds
that
God
made
the
world
including
humanity
perfect
holy
and
sinless
However
Adam
and
Eve
chose
to
disobey
God
trusting
in
their
own
strength
knowledge
and
wisdom
74
75
Consequently
people
are
saddled
with
original
sin
born
sinful
and
unable
to
avoid
committing
sinful
acts
76
For
Lutherans
original
sin
is
the
chief
sin
a
root
and
fountainhead
of
all
actual
sins
77
Lutherans
teach
that
sinners
while
capable
of
doing
works
that
are
outwardly
good
are
not
capable
of
doing
works
that
satisfy
God
s
justice
78
Every
human
thought
and
deed
is
infected
with
sin
and
sinful
motives
79
Because
of
this
all
humanity
deserves
eternal
damnation
in
hell
80
God
in
eternity
has
turned
His
Fatherly
heart
to
this
world
and
planned
for
its
redemption
because
he
loves
all
people
and
does
not
want
anyone
to
be
eternally
damned
81
To
this
end
God
sent
his
Son
Jesus
Christ
our
Lord
into
the
world
to
redeem
and
deliver
us
from
the
power
of
the
devil
and
to
bring
us
to
Himself
and
to
govern
us
as
a
King
of
righteousness
life
and
salvation
against
sin
death
and
an
evil
conscience
as
Luther
s
Large
Catechism
explains
82
Because
of
this
Lutherans
teach
that
salvation
is
possible
only
because
of
the
grace
of
God
made
manifest
in
the
birth
life
suffering
death
and
resurrection
and
continuing
presence
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Spirit
of
Jesus
Christ
83
By
God
s
grace
made
known
and
effective
in
the
person
and
work
of
Jesus
Christ
a
person
is
forgiven
adopted
as
a
child
and
heir
of
God
and
given
eternal
salvation
84
Christ
because
he
was
entirely
obedient
to
the
law
with
respect
to
both
his
human
and
divine
natures
is
a
perfect
satisfaction
and
reconciliation
of
the
human
race
as
the
Formula
of
Concord
asserts
and
proceeds
to
summarize
85
Christ
submitted
to
the
law
for
us
bore
our
sin
and
in
going
to
his
Father
performed
complete
and
perfect
obedience
for
us
poor
sinners
from
his
holy
birth
to
his
death
Thereby
he
covered
all
our
disobedience
which
is
embedded
in
our
nature
and
in
its
thoughts
words
and
deeds
so
that
this
disobedience
is
not
reckoned
to
us
as
condemnation
but
is
pardoned
and
forgiven
by
sheer
grace
because
of
Christ
alone
Lutherans
believe
that
individuals
receive
this
gift
of
salvation
through
faith
alone
86
Saving
faith
is
the
knowledge
of
87
acceptance
of
88
and
trust
89
in
the
promise
of
the
Gospel
90
Even
faith
itself
is
seen
as
a
gift
of
God
created
in
the
hearts
of
Christians
91
by
the
work
of
the
Holy
Spirit
through
the
Word
92
and
Baptism
93
Faith
receives
the
gift
of
salvation
rather
than
causes
salvation
94
Thus
Lutherans
reject
the
decision
theology
which
is
common
among
modern
evangelicals
Since
the
term
grace
has
been
defined
differently
by
other
Christian
church
bodies
e
g
Roman
Catholicism
95
it
is
important
to
note
that
Lutheranism
defines
grace
as
entirely
limited
to
God
s
gifts
to
us
Justification
comes
as
a
pure
gift
not
something
we
merit
by
changed
behavior
or
in
which
we
cooperate
Grace
is
not
about
our
response
to
God
s
gifts
but
only
His
gifts
Trinity
edit
Lutherans
believe
in
the
Trinity
Lutherans
are
Trinitarian
Lutherans
reject
the
idea
that
the
Father
and
the
Son
are
merely
faces
of
the
same
person
stating
that
both
the
Old
Testament
and
the
New
Testament
show
them
to
be
two
distinct
persons
96
Lutherans
believe
the
Holy
Spirit
proceeds
from
both
the
Father
and
the
Son
97
In
the
words
of
the
Athanasian
Creed
We
worship
one
God
in
Trinity
and
Trinity
in
Unity
Neither
confounding
the
Persons
nor
dividing
the
Substance
For
there
is
one
Person
of
the
Father
another
of
the
Son
and
another
of
the
Holy
Ghost
But
the
Godhead
of
the
Father
of

and
of

Ghost
is
all
one

Lutherans
are

about
the
number
of
the
sacraments
110
In
line
with
Luther
s
initial
statement
in
his
Large
Catechism
some
speak
of
only
two
sacraments
111
Baptism
and
Holy
Communion
although
later
in

he
calls
Confession
and
Absolution
112
the
third

113
The
definition
of
sacrament
in
the
Apology
of
the
Augsburg
Confession
lists
Absolution
as
one
of
them
114
Since
Absolution
is
a
return
to
the
forgiveness
given

Rite

Baptism
edit
German
reformer
Philipp
Melanchthon
baptizing
an
infant
Lutherans
hold
that
Baptism
is
a
saving
work
of
God
116
mandated
and
instituted
by
Jesus
Christ
117
Baptism
is
a
means
of
grace
through
which
God
creates
and
strengthens
saving
faith
as
the
washing
of
regeneration
118
in
which
infants
and
adults
are
reborn
119
Since
the
creation
of
faith
is
exclusively
God
s
work
it
does
not
depend
on
the
actions
of
the
one
baptized
whether
infant
or
adult
Even
though
baptized
infants
cannot
articulate
that
faith
Lutherans
believe
that
it
is
present
all
the
same
120
Because
it
is
faith
alone
that
receives
these
divine
gifts
Lutherans
confess
that
baptism
works
forgiveness
of
sins
delivers
from
death
and
the
devil
and
gives
eternal
salvation
to
all
who
believe
this
as
the
words
and
promises
of
God
declare
121
Holding
fast
to
the
Scripture
cited
in
1
Peter

21
Baptism
which
corresponds
to
this
now
saves
you
not
as
a
removal
of
dirt
from
the
body
but
as
an
appeal
to
God
for
a
good
conscience
through
the
resurrection
of
Jesus
Christ
122
Therefore
Lutherans
administer
Baptism
to
both
infants
123
and
adults
124
In
the
special
section
on
infant
baptism
in
his
Large
Catechism
Luther
argues
that
infant
baptism
is
God
pleasing
because
persons
so
baptized
were
reborn
and
sanctified
by
the
Holy
Spirit

Conversion

A

Article
XII
Of
Repentance
In
Lutheranism
conversion
or
regeneration
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
is
the
work
of
divine
grace
and
power
by
which
man
born
of
the
flesh
and
void
of
all
power
to
think
to
will
or
to
do
any
good
thing
and
dead
in
sin
is
through
the
gospel
and
holy
baptism
taken
from
a
state
of
sin
and
spiritual
death
under
God
s
wrath
into
a
state
of
spiritual
life
of
faith
and
grace
rendered
able
to
will
and
to
do
what
is
spiritually
good
and
especially
made
to
trust
in
the
benefits
of
the
redemption
which
is
in
Christ
Jesus
129
During
conversion
one
is
moved
from
impenitence
to
repentance
The
Augsburg
Confession
divides
repentance
into
two
parts
One
is
contrition
that
is
terrors
smiting
the
conscience
through
the
knowledge
of
sin
the
other
is
faith
which
is
born
of
the
Gospel
or
of
absolution
and
believes
that
for
Christ
s
sake
sins
are
forgiven
comforts
the
conscience
and
delivers
it
from
terrors
130
Predestination
edit
A
C
Article
18
Of
Free
Will
131
Lutherans
adhere
to
divine
monergism
the
teaching
that
salvation
is
by
God
s
act
alone
and
therefore
reject
the
idea
that
humans
in
their
fallen
state
have
a
free
will
concerning
spiritual
matters
132
Lutherans
believe
that
although
humans
have
free
will
concerning
civil
righteousness
they
cannot
work
spiritual
righteousness
in
the
heart
without
the
presence
and
aid
of
the
Holy
Spirit
133
134
Lutherans
believe
Christians
are
saved
135
that
all
who
trust
in
Christ
alone
and
his
promises
can
be
certain
of
their
salvation
136
According
to
Lutheranism
the
central
final
hope
of
the
Christian
is
the
resurrection
of
the
body
and
the
life
everlasting
as
confessed
in
the
Apostles
Creed
rather
than
predestination
Lutherans
disagree
with
those
who
make
predestination
rather
than
Christ
s
suffering
death
and
resurrection
the
source
of
salvation
Unlike
some
Calvinists
Lutherans
do
not
believe
in
a
predestination
to
damnation
137
usually
referencing
God
our
Savior
who
desires
all
people
to
be
saved
and
to
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
138
as
contrary
evidence
to
such
a
claim
Instead
Lutherans
teach
eternal
damnation
is
a
result
of
the
unbeliever
s
sins
rejection
of
the
forgiveness
of
sins
and
unbelief
139
Divine
providence
edit
According
to
Lutherans
God
preserves
his
creation
cooperates
with
everything
that
happens
and
guides
the
universe
140
While
God
cooperates
with
both
good
and
evil
deeds
with
evil
deeds
he
does
so
only
inasmuch
as
they
are
deeds
but
not
with
the
evil
in
them
God
concurs
with
an
act
s
effect
but
he
does
not
cooperate
in
the
corruption
of
an
act
or
the
evil
of
its
effect
141
Lutherans
believe
everything
exists
for
the
sake
of
the
Christian
Church
and
that
God
guides
everything
for
its
welfare
and
growth
142
The
explanation
of
the
Apostles
Creed
given
in
the
Small
Catechism
declares
that
everything
good
that
people
have
is
given
and
preserved
by
God
either
directly
or
through
other
people
or
things
143
Of
the
services
others
provide
us
through
family
government
and
work
we
receive
these
blessings
not
from
them
but
through
them
from
God
144
Since
God
uses
everyone
s
useful
tasks
for
good
people
should
not
look
down
upon
some
useful
vocations
as
being
less
worthy
than
others
Instead
people
should
honor
others
no
matter
how
lowly
as
being
the
means
God
uses
to
work
in
the
world
144
Good
works
edit
Even
though
I
am
a
sinner
and
deserving
of
death
and
hell
this
shall
nonetheless
be
my
consolation
and
my
victory
that
my
Lord
Jesus
lives
and
has
risen
so
that
He
in
the
end
might
rescue
me
from
sin
death
and
hell
Luther
145
Lutherans
believe
that
good
works
are
the
fruit
of
faith
146
always
and
in
every
instance
147
Good
works
have
their
origin
in
God
148
not
in
the
fallen
human
heart
or
in
human
striving
149
their
absence
would
demonstrate
that
faith
too
is
absent
150
Lutherans
do
not
believe
that
good
works
are
a
factor
in
obtaining
salvation
they
believe
that
we
are
saved
by
the
grace
of
God
based
on
the
merit
of
Christ
in
his
suffering
and
death
and
faith
in
the
Triune
God
Good
works
are
the
natural
result
of
faith
not
the
cause
of
salvation
Although
Christians
are
no
longer
compelled
to
keep
God
s
law
they
freely
and
willingly
serve
God
and
their
neighbors

there
are
substantial
non

minorities
for
example
the
Haugean
Lutherans
from
Norway
Martin
Luther
was
a
great
fan
of
music
and
this
is
why
it
forms
a
large
part
of
Lutheran
services
in
particular
Luther
admired
the
composers
Josquin
des
Prez
and
Ludwig
Senfl
and
wanted
singing
in
the
church
to
move
away
from
the
ars
perfecta
Catholic
Sacred
Music
of
the
late
Renaissance
and
towards
singing
as
a
Gemeinschaft
community
202
Lutheran
hymns
are
sometimes
known
as
chorales
Lutheran
hymnody
is
well
known
for
its
doctrinal
didactic
and
musical
richness
Most
Lutheran
churches
are
active
musically
with
choirs
handbell

children
s
choirs
and
occasionally
change
ringing
groups
that
ring
bells
in
a
bell
tower
Johann
Sebastian
Bach
a
devout
Lutheran
composed
music
for
the
Lutheran
church
Lutherans
also
preserve
a
liturgical
approach
to
the
celebration
of
the
Mass
or
the
Holy
Eucharist
Communion
emphasizing
the
sacrament
as
the
central
act
of
Christian
worship
Lutherans
believe
that
the
actual
body
and
blood
of
Jesus
Christ
are
present
in
with
and
under
the
bread
and
the
wine
This
belief
is
called
Real
Presence
or
sacramental
union
and
is
different
from
consubstantiation
and
transubstantiation
Additionally
Lutherans
reject
the
idea
that
communion
is
a
mere
symbol
or
memorial
They
confess
in
the
Apology
of
the
Augsburg
Confession
W
e
do
not
abolish
the
Mass
but
religiously
keep
and
defend
it
Among
us
the
Mass
is
celebrated
every
Lord
s
Day
and
on
other
festivals
when
the
Sacrament
is
made
available
to
those
who
wish
to
partake
of
it
after
they
have
been
examined
and
absolved
We
also
keep
traditional
liturgical
forms
such
as
the
order
of
readings
prayers
vestments
and
other
similar
things
203
Besides
the
Holy
Communion
Divine
Service
congregations
also
hold
offices
which
are
worship
services
without
communion
They
may
include
Matins
Vespers
Compline
and
Easter
Vigil
Private
or
family
offices
include
the
Morning
and
Evening
Prayers
from
Luther
s
Small
Catechism
204
Meals
are
blessed
with
the
Common

Prayer
Psalm

or
other
prayers
and
after
eating
the
Lord
is
thanked
for
example
with
Psalm

204
In
addition
Lutherans
use
devotional
books
from
small
daily
devotionals
for
example
Portals
of
Prayer
to
large
breviaries
including
the
Breviarium
Lipsiensae
and
Treasury
of
Daily
Prayer
In
the
1970s
many
Lutheran
churches
began
holding
contemporary
worship
services
for
the
purpose
of
evangelistic
outreach
These
services
were
in
a
variety
of
styles
depending
on
the
preferences
of
the
congregation
Often
they
were
held
alongside
a
traditional
service
in
order
to
cater
to
those
who
preferred
contemporary
worship
music
Today
few
but
some
Lutheran
congregations
have
contemporary
worship
as
their
sole
form
of
worship
Outreach
is
no
longer
given
as
the
primary
motivation
rather
this
form
of
worship
is
seen
as
more
in
keeping
with
the
desires
of
individual
congregations
205
In
Finland
Lutherans
have
experimented
with
the
St
Thomas
Mass
fi
and

in
which
traditional
hymns
are
adapted
to

The

Lutheran
character
In
recent
years
India
has
relaxed
its
anti
religious
conversion
laws
allowing
a
resurgence
in
missionary
work
In
Latin
America
missions
began
to
serve
European
immigrants
of
Lutheran
background
both
those
who
spoke
German
and
those
who
no
longer
did
These
churches
in
turn
began
to
evangelize
those
in
their
areas
who
were
not
of
European
background
including
indigenous
peoples
209
In
1892
the
first
Lutheran
missionaries
reached
Japan
Although
work
began
slowly
and
a
major
setback
occurred
during
the
hardships
of
WWII
210
Lutheranism
there
has
survived
and
become
self
sustaining
211
After
missionaries
to
China
including
those
of
the
Lutheran
Church
of
China
were
expelled
they
began
ministry
in
Taiwan
and
Hong
Kong
the
latter
which
became
a
center
of
Lutheranism
in
Asia
211
The
Lutheran
Mission
in
New
Guinea
though
founded
only
in
1953
became
the
largest
Lutheran
mission
in
the
world
in
only
several
decades
Through
the
work
of
native
lay
evangelists
many
tribes
of
diverse
languages
were
reached

aspect
of
Lutheran
mission
work

and

Pastors
almost
always
have
substantial
theological
educations
including
Koine
Greek
and
Biblical
Hebrew
so
that
they
can
refer
to
the
Christian
scriptures
in
the
original
language
Pastors
usually
teach
in
the
common
language
of
the
local
congregation
In
the
U
S
some
congregations
and
synods
historically
taught
in
German
Danish
Finnish
Norwegian
or
Swedish
but
retention
of
immigrant
languages
has
been
in
significant
decline
since
the
early
and

20th
century
Church
fellowship
edit
Lutherans
were
divided
about
the
issue
of
church
fellowship
for
the
first
thirty
years
after
Luther
s
death
Philipp
Melanchthon
and
his
Philippist
party
felt
that
Christians
of
different
beliefs
should
join
in
union
with
each
other
without
completely
agreeing
on
doctrine
Against
them
stood
the
Gnesio
Lutherans
led
by
Matthias
Flacius
and
the
faculty
at
the
University
of
Jena
They
condemned
the
Philippist
position
for
indifferentism
describing
it
as
a
unionistic
compromise
of
precious
Reformation
theology
Instead
they
held
that
genuine
unity
between
Christians
and
real
theological
peace
was
only
possible
with
an
honest
agreement
about
every
subject
of
doctrinal
controversy
214
Hallowed
be
Thy
Name

Lucas
Cranach
the
Elder

a
Lutheran
pastor
preaching
Christ
crucified
Complete
agreement
finally
came
about
in
1577
after
the
death
of
both
Melanchthon
and
Flacius
when
a
new
generation
of
theologians
resolved
the
doctrinal
controversies
on
the
basis
of
Scripture
in
the
Formula
of
Concord
of
1577
215
Although
they
decried
the
visible
division
of
Christians
on
earth
orthodox
Lutherans
avoided
ecumenical
fellowship
with
other
churches
believing
that
Christians
should
not
for
example
join
together
for
the
Lord
s
Supper
or
exchange
pastors
if
they
do
not
completely
agree
about
what
the
Bible
teaches
In
the
17th
century
Georgius
Calixtus
began
a
rebellion
against
this
practice
sparking
the
Syncretistic
Controversy
with
Abraham
Calovius
as
his
main
opponent
216
In
the
18th
century
there
was
some
ecumenical
interest
between
the
Church
of
Sweden
and
the
Church
of
England
John
Robinson
Bishop
of
London
planned
for
a
union
of
the
English
and
Swedish
churches
in
1718
The
plan
failed
because
most
Swedish
bishops
rejected
the
Calvinism
of
the
Church
of
England
although
Jesper
Swedberg
and
Johannes
Gezelius
the
younger
bishops
of
Skara
Sweden
and
Turku
Finland
were
in
favor
217
With
the
encouragement
of
Swedberg
church
fellowship
was
established
between
Swedish
Lutherans
and
Anglicans
in
the
Middle
Colonies
Over
the
course
of
the
1700s
and
the
early
1800s
Swedish
Lutherans
were
absorbed
into
Anglican
churches
with
the
last
original
Swedish
congregation
completing
merger
into
the
Episcopal
Church
in
1846
218
In
the
19th
century
Samuel
Simon
Schmucker
attempted
to
lead
the
Evangelical
Lutheran
General
Synod
of
the
United
States
toward
unification
with
other
American
Protestants
His
attempt
to
get
the
synod
to
reject
the
Augsburg
Confession
in
favor
of
his
compromising
Definite
Platform
failed
Instead
it
sparked
a
Neo
Lutheran
revival
prompting
many
to
form
the
General
Council
including
Charles
Porterfield
Krauth
Their
alternative
approach
was
Lutheran
pulpits
for
Lutheran
ministers
only
and
Lutheran
altars
for
Lutheran
communicants
only

confessional

Conference
against
the
ever
looming
prospect
of
a
state
mandated
union
with
the
Reformed
220
However
they
failed
to
reach
consensus
on
the
degree
of
shared
doctrine
necessary
for
church
union
39
Eventually
the
fascist
German
Christians
movement
pushed
the
final
national
merger
of
Lutheran
Union
and
Reformed
church
bodies
into
a
single
Reich

in
1933

away

previous

the
United
Evangelical
Lutheran
Church
of
Germany
Presently
Lutherans
are
divided
over
how
to
interact
with
other
Christian
denominations
Some
Lutherans
assert
that
everyone
must
share

whole
counsel
of
God

before
pastors
can
share
each
other
s
pulpits
and
before
communicants
commune
at
each
other
s
altars
a
practice
termed
closed
or
close
communion
On
the
other
hand
other
Lutherans
practice
varying
degrees
of
open
communion
and
allow
preachers
from
other
Christian
denominations
in
their
pulpits
While
not
an
issue
in
the
majority
of
Lutheran
church
bodies
some
of
them
forbid
membership
in
Freemasonry
Partly
this
is
because
the
lodge
is
viewed
as
spreading
Unitarianism
as
the
Brief
Statement
of
the
LCMS
reads
Hence
we
warn
against
Unitarianism
which
in
our
country
has
to
a
great
extent
impenetrated
the
sects
and
is
being
spread
particularly
also
through
the
influence
of
the
lodges
222
A
1958
report
from
the
publishing
house
of
the
Wisconsin
Evangelical
Lutheran
Synod
states
that
Masonry
is
guilty
of
idolatry
Its
worship
and
prayers
are
idol
worship
The
Masons
may
not
with
their
hands
have
made
an
idol
out
of
gold
silver
wood
or
stone
but
they
created
one
with
their
own
mind
and
reason
out
of
purely
human
thoughts
and
ideas
The
latter
is
an
idol
no
less
than
the
former

are
the
Lutheran
World

LWF
the
International

ILC
and
the
Confessional
Evangelical

CELC
These
organizations
together
include
the
great
majority
of
Lutheran
denominations
around
the
globe
The
Lutheran
World

supports
the
activities
of
Lutheran
World

a

active

The
LCMS
and
the
Lutheran
Church
Canada
are
members
of
the
ILC
The
WELS
and
ELS
are
members
of
the
CELC
Many
Lutheran
churches
are
not
affiliated
with
the
LWF
the
ILC
or
the
CELC
The
congregations
of
the
Church
of
the
Lutheran
Confession
CLC
are
affiliated
with
their
mission
organizations
in
Canada
India
Nepal
Myanmar
and
many
African
nations
and
those
affiliated
with
the
Church
of
the
Lutheran
Brethren
are
especially
active
doing
mission
work
in
Africa
and
East
Asia
The
Lutheran
World
Federation
aligned
churches
do
not
believe
that
one
church
is
singularly
true
in
its
teachings
According
to
this
belief
Lutheranism
is
a
reform
movement
rather
than
a
movement
into
doctrinal
correctness
For
that
reason
a
number
of
doctrinally
diverse
LWF
denominations
now
largely
separated
from
state
control
are
declaring
fellowship
and
joint
statements
of
agreement
with
other
Lutheran
and
non
Lutheran
Christian
denominations
The
Lutheran
World
Federation
and
the
Lutheran
Church
Missouri
Synod
engaged
in
a
series
of
official
dialogues
with
the
Catholic
Church
since
shortly
after
the
Second
Vatican
Council
In
1999
the
LWF
and
the
Catholic
Church
jointly
issued
a
statement
the
Joint
Declaration
on
the
Doctrine
of
Justification
that
stated
that
the
LWF
and
the
Catholic
both
agreed
about
certain
basics
of
Justification
and
lifted
certain
Catholic
anathemas
formerly
applying
to
the
LWF
member
churches
The
LCMS
has
participated
in
most
of
these
talks
though
not
the
one
which
produced
the
Joint
Declaration
and
to
which
they
were
not
invited
While
some
Lutheran
theologians
saw
the
Joint
Declaration
as
a
sign
that
the
Catholics
were
essentially
adopting
the
Lutheran
position
other
Lutheran
theologians
disagreed
claiming
that
considering
the
public
documentation
of
the
Catholic
position
this
assertion
does
not
hold
up
citation
needed
By
contrast
the
Confessional
Evangelical
Lutheran
Conference
and
International
Lutheran
Council
as
well
as
some
unaffiliated
denominations
such
as
the
Church
of
the
Lutheran
Confession
maintain
that
the
orthodox
confessional
Lutheran
churches
are
the
only
churches
with
completely
correct
doctrine
They
teach
that
while
other
Christian
churches
teach
partially
orthodox
doctrine
and
have
true
Christians
as
members
the
doctrines
of
those
churches
contain
significant
errors
More
conservative
Lutherans
strive
to
maintain
historical
distinctiveness
while
emphasizing
doctrinal
purity
alongside
Gospel
motivated
outreach
They
claim
that
LWF
Lutherans
are
practicing
fake
ecumenism
by
desiring
church
fellowship
outside
of
actual
unity
of
teaching
224
Although
not
an
ecumenical
movement
in
the
formal
sense
in
the
1990s
influences
from
the
megachurches
of
American
evangelicalism
have
become
somewhat
common
Many
of
the
largest
Lutheran
congregations
in
the
United
States
have
been
heavily
influenced
by
these
progressive
Evangelicals
These
influences
are
sharply
criticized
by
some
Lutherans
as
being
foreign
to
orthodox
Lutheran
beliefs

As

for

which
rejected
iconoclasm
and
restored
the
veneration

in

was
not
part
of
the
tradition
received
by

Lutherans
however
rejected
the
iconoclasm
of
the
16th
century
and
affirmed
the

adoration
due

the
Triune
God
alone
and
all
other
forms
of
veneration
CA
21
Through
historical
research
this
council
has
become
better
known
Nevertheless
it
does
not
have
the
same
significance
for
Lutherans
as
it
does
for
the
Orthodox
Yet
Lutherans
and
Orthodox
are
in
agreement
that
the
Second
Council
of
Nicaea
confirms
the
christological
teaching
of
the
earlier
councils
and
in
setting
forth
the
role
of
images
icons
in
the
lives
of
the
faithful
reaffirms
the
reality
of
the
incarnation
of
the
eternal
Word
of
God
when
it
states
The
more
frequently
Christ
Mary
the
mother
of
God
and
the
saints
are
seen
the
more
are
those
who
see
them
drawn
to
remember
and
long
for
those
who
serve
as
models
and
to
pay
these
icons
the
tribute
of
salutation
and
respectful
veneration
Certainly
this
is
not
the
full
adoration
in
accordance
with
our
faith
which
is
properly
paid
only
to
the
divine
nature
but
it
resembles
that
given
to
the
figure
of
the
honored
and
life
giving
cross
and
also
to
the
holy
books
of
the
gospels
and
to
other
sacred
objects

Luther
s
Catholic
Reformation
The
Lutheran
Witness
When
the
Lutherans
presented
the
Augsburg
Confession
before
Emperor
Charles
V
in
1530
they
carefully
showed
that
each
article
of
faith
and
practice
was
true
first
of
all
to
Holy
Scripture
and
then
also
to
the
teaching
of
the
church
fathers
and
the
councils
and
even
the
canon
law
of
the
Church
of
Rome
They
boldly
claim
This
is
about
the
Sum
of
our
Doctrine
in
which
as
can
be
seen
there
is
nothing
that
varies
from
the
Scriptures
or
from
the
Church
Catholic
or
from
the
Church
of
Rome
as
known
from
its
writers
AC
XXI
Conclusion
1
The
underlying
thesis
of
the
Augsburg
Confession
is
that
the
faith
as
confessed
by
Luther
and
his
followers
is
nothing
new
but
the
true
catholic
faith
and
that
their
churches
represent
the
true
catholic
or
universal
church
In
fact
it
is
actually
the
Church
of
Rome
that
has
departed
from
the
ancient
faith
and
practice
of
the
catholic
church

We
believe
we
have
the
duty
not
to
neglect
any
of
the
rites
and
ceremonies
instituted
in
Scripture
whatever
their
number
We
do
not
think
it
makes
much
difference
if
for
purposes
of
teaching
the
enumeration
varies
provided
what
is
handed
down
in

is
preserved

We
have
now
finished
the
three
chief
parts
of
the
common
Christian
doctrine
Besides
these
we
have
yet
to
speak
of
our
two
Sacraments
instituted
by
Christ
of
which
also
every
Christian
ought
to
have
at
least
an
ordinary
brief
instruction
because
without
them
there
can
be
no
Christian
although
alas
hitherto
no
instruction
concerning
them
has
been
given

And
here
you
see
that
Baptism
both
in
its
power
and
signification
comprehends
also
the
third
Sacrament
which
has
been
called
repentance
as
it
is
really
nothing
else
than
Baptism

If
we
define
the
sacraments
as
rites
which
have
the
command
of
God
and
to
which
the
promise
of
grace
has
been
added
it
is
easy
to
determine
what
the
sacraments
are
properly
speaking
For
humanly
instituted
rites
are
not
sacraments
properly
speaking
because
human
beings
do
not
have
the
authority
to
promise
grace
Therefore
signs
instituted
without
the
command
of
God
are
not
sure
signs
of
grace
even
though
they
perhaps
serve
to
teach
or
admonish
the
common
folk
Therefore
the
sacraments
are
actually
baptism
the
Lord
s
Supper
and
absolution
the
sacrament
of
repentance

was
ruler
of
both
the
Spanish
Empire
as
Charles
I
from
1516
and
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
as
Charles
V
from
1519
as
well
as
of
the
lands
of
the
former
Duchy
of
Burgundy
from
1506
He
voluntarily
stepped
down
from
these
and
other
positions
by
a
series
of
abdications
between
1554
and
1556
Through
inheritance
he
brought
together
under
his
rule
extensive
territories
in
western
central
and
southern
Europe
and
the
Spanish
colonies
in
the
Americas
and
Asia
As
a
result
his
domains
spanned
nearly
four
million
square
kilometers
3
and
were
the
first
to
be
described
as
the
empire
on
which
the
sun
never
sets
4
Charles
was
the
heir
of
three
of
Europe
s
leading
dynasties
the
Houses
of
Valois
Burgundy
through
his
paternal
grandmother
Habsburg
and
Trast
mara
his
maternal
grandparents
were
the
Catholic
Monarchs
of
Spain
He
inherited
the
Netherlands
and
the
Franche
Comt
as
heir
of
the
House
of
Valois
Burgundy
From
his
own
dynasty
the
Habsburgs
he
inherited
Austria
and
other
lands
in
central
Europe
He
was
also
elected
to
succeed
his
Habsburg
grandfather
Maximilian
I
as
Holy
Roman
Emperor
a
title
held
by
the
Habsburgs
since
1440
From
the
Spanish
House
of
Trast
mara
he
inherited
the
crowns
of
Castile
which
was
in
the
process
of
developing
a
nascent
empire
in
the
Americas
and
Asia
and
Crown
of
Aragon
which
included
a
Mediterranean
empire
extending
to
Southern
Italy
Charles
was
the
first
king
to
rule
Castile
and
Aragon
simultaneously
in
his
own
right
and
as
a
result
he
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
first
king
of
Spain
5
The
personal
union
under
Charles
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
with
the
Spanish
Empire
resulted
in
the
closest
Europe
would
come
to
a
universal
monarchy
since
the
death
of
Louis
the
Pious
Because
of
widespread
fears
that
his
vast
inheritance
would
lead
to
the
realization
of
a
universal
monarchy
and
that
he
was
trying
to
create
a
European
hegemony
Charles
was
the
object
of
hostility
from
many
enemies
6
His
reign
was
dominated
by
war
and
particularly
by
three
major
simultaneous
conflicts
the
Habsburg
Valois
Wars
with
France
the
struggle
to
halt
the
Ottoman
advance
and
the
Protestant
Reformation
resulting
in
conflict
with
the
German
princes
7
The
wars
with
France
mainly
fought
in
Italy
resulted
in
recovery
of
territory
lost
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
and
included
the
decisive
defeat
and
capture
of
Francis
I
of
France
at
the
Battle
of
Pavia
in
1525
France
recovered
and
the
wars
continued
for
the
remainder
of
Charles
s
reign
Enormously
expensive
they
led
to
the
development
of
the
first
modern
professional
army
in
Europe
the
Tercios
The
struggle
with
the
Ottoman
Empire
was
fought
in
Hungary
and
the
Mediterranean
After
crushing
Hungarian
forces
in
1526
the
Ottomans
advance
was
halted
at
their
failed
Siege
of
Vienna
in
1529
A
lengthy
war
of
attrition
conducted
on
his
behalf
by
his
younger
brother
Ferdinand
who
had
become
king
of
Hungary
continued
for
the
rest
of
Charles
s
reign
In
the
Mediterranean
although
there
were
some
successes
Charles
was
unable
to
prevent
the
Ottomans
increasing
naval
dominance
and
the
piratical
activity
of
the
Barbary
corsairs
Charles
opposed
the
Reformation
and
in
Germany
he
was
in
conflict
with
the
Protestant
Princes
of
the
Schmalkaldic
League
who
were
motivated
by
both
religious
and
political
opposition
to
him
He
could
not
prevent
the
spread
of
Protestantism
and
although
he
won
a
decisive
victory
against
the
Princes
at
the
Battle
of
M
hlberg
1547
he
was
ultimately
forced
to
concede
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
of
1555
which
divided
Germany
on
confessional
lines
While
Charles
did
not
typically
concern
himself
with
rebellions
he
was
quick
to
put
down
three
particularly
dangerous
rebellions
in
the
vital
territories
of
Castile
the
Frisian
lands
and
later
in
his
reign
in
the
city
of
Ghent
Once
the
rebellions
were
quelled
the
essential
Castilian
and
Burgundian
territories
remained
mostly
loyal
to
Charles
throughout
his
rule
Charles
s
Spanish
dominions
were
the
chief
source
of
his
power
and
wealth
and
they
became
increasingly
important
as
his
reign
progressed
In
the
Americas
Charles
sanctioned
the
conquest
by
Castillian
conquistadores
of
the
Aztec
and
Inca
empires
Castillian
control
was
extended
across
much
of
South
and
Central
America
The
resulting
vast
expansion
of
territory
and
the
flows
of
South
American
silver
to
Castile
had
profound
long
term
effects
on
Spain
Charles
was
only
56
when
he
abdicated
but
after
40
years
of
energetic
rule
he
was
physically
exhausted
and
sought
the
peace
of
a
monastery
where
he
died
at
the
age
of
58
Upon
Charles
s
abdications
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
was
inherited
by
his
younger
brother
Ferdinand
who
had
already
been
given
the
Austrian
lands
in
1521
The
Spanish
Empire
including
the
possessions
in
the
Netherlands
and
Italy
was
inherited
by
Charles
s
son
Philip
II
The
two
empires
would
remain
allies
until
the
18th
century
when
the
Spanish
branch
of
the
House
of
Habsburg
became
extinct

Heritage
and
early
life
edit
Portrait
by
Bernard
van
Orley
1519
Charles
was
born
in
1500
as
the
eldest
son
of
Philip
the
Handsome
and
Joanna
of
Castile
in
the
Flemish
city
of
Ghent
which
was
part
of
the
Habsburg
Netherlands
8
The
culture
and
courtly
life
of
the
Burgundian
Low
Countries
were
an
important
influence
in
his
early
life
He
was
tutored
by
William
de
Cro
who
would
later
become
his
first
prime
minister
and
also
by
Adrian
of
Utrecht
later
Pope
Adrian
VI
It
is
said
that
Charles
spoke
several
vernacular
languages
he
was
fluent
in
French
and
Dutch
later
adding
an
acceptable
Castilian
Spanish
which
Charles
called
the
divine
language
9
required
by
the
Castilian
Cortes
Generales
as
a
condition
for
becoming
King
of
Castile
He
also
gained
a
decent
command
of
German
in
which
he
was
not
fluent
prior
to
his
election
though
he
never
spoke
it
as
well
as
French
10
A
witticism
sometimes
attributed
to
Charles
is
I
speak
Spanish
to
God
Italian
to
women
French
to
men
and
German
to
my
horse
A
variant
of
the
quote
is
attributed
to
him
by
Swift
in
his
1726
Gulliver
s
Travels
but
there
are
many
other
variants
and
it
is
often
attributed
instead
to
Frederick
the
Great
11
From
his
Burgundian
ancestors
he
inherited
an
ambiguous
relationship
with
the
Kings
of
France
Charles
shared
with
France
his
mother
tongue
and
many
cultural
forms
In
his
youth
he
made
frequent
visits
to
Paris
then
the
largest
city
of
Western
Europe
In
his
words
Paris
is
not
a
city
but
a
universe
Lutetia
non
urbs
sed
orbis
He
was
betrothed
to
both
Louise
and
Charlotte
of
Valois
daughters
of
King
Francis
I
of
France
but
they
both
died
in
childhood
Charles
also
inherited
the
tradition
of
political
and
dynastic
enmity
between
the
royal
and
the
Burgundian
ducal
lines
of
the
Valois
dynasty
Charles
was
very
attached
to
the
Burgundian
Low
Countries
where
he
had
been
raised
These
lands
were
very
rich
and
contributed
significantly
to
the
wealth
of
the
Empire
He
also
spent
much
time
there
mainly
in
Brussels
This
stands
in
contrast
with
the
attitude
of
his
son
Philip
who
only
visited
the
Low
Countries
once
Portrait
by
Jakob
Seisenegger
1533
Until
the
1540s
Charles
did
not
spend
much
time
in
Germany
apart
from
the
Netherlands
He
frequently
was
in
Northern
Italy
then
part
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
of
German
Nation
He
never
actually
governed
his
Austrian
dominions
and
made
his
brother
Ferdinand
the
ruler
of
these
lands
in
1521
as
well
as
his
representative
in
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
during
his
absence
In
spite
of
this
the
Emperor
had
a
close
relationship
with
some
German
families
like
the
House
of
Nassau
many
of
which
were
represented
at
his
court
in
Brussels
Some
German
princes
or
noblemen
accompanied
him
in
his
military
campaigns
against
France
or
the
Ottomans
and
the
bulk
of
his
army
was
generally
composed
of
German
troops
especially
the
Imperial
Landsknechte
12
Indeed
in
1519
he
was
elected
because
he
was
considered
a
German
prince
while
his
main
opponent
was
French
Nonetheless
in
the
long
term
the
growth
of
Lutheranism
and
Charles
staunch
Catholicism
alienated
him
from
various
German
princes
who
finally
fought
against
him
in
the
1540s
and
the
1550s
It
is
important
to
note
though
that
other
states
of
the
Empire
chose
to
support
him
in
his
war
and
that
he
had
the
constant
support
of
his
brother
in
spite
of
their
strained
personal
relationship
13
Whereas
Charles
spent
much
of
his
final
years
as
a
ruler
trying
to
address
the
issue
of
religion
in
the
Empire
it
would
ultimately
be
Ferdinand
by
then
much
more
popular
in
Germany
who
would
bring
peace
to
the
German
lands
Though
Spain
was
the
core
of
his
personal
possessions
and
though
he
had
many
Iberian
ancestors
in
his
earlier
years
Charles
felt
as
if
he
were
viewed
as
a
foreign
prince
He
became
fluent
in
Spanish
late
in
his
life
as
it
was
not
his
first
language
Nonetheless
he
spent
much
of
his
life
in
Spain
including
his
final
years
in
a
Spanish
monastery
and
his
heir
later
Philip
II
was
born
and
raised
in
Spain
Indeed
Charles
s
motto
Plus
Ultra
Further
Beyond
became
the
national
motto
of
Spain
He
had
many
Spanish
counselors
and
except
for
the
revolt
of
the
comuneros
in
the
1520s
Spain
remained
mostly
loyal
to
him
Spain
was
also
his
most
important
military
asset
as
it
provided
a
great
number
of
generals
as
well
as
the
formidable
Spanish
tercios
considered
the
best
infantry
of
its
time
Many
Spaniards
however
believed
that
their
resources
were
being
used
to
sustain
a
policy
that
was
not
in
the
country
s
interest
14
They
usually
believed
that
Charles
should
have
focused
on
the
Mediterranean
and
North
Africa
instead
of
Northern
or
Central
Europe

In
1506
Charles
inherited
his
father
s
Burgundian
territories
most
notably
the
Low
Countries
and
Franche
Comt
Most
of
the
holdings
were
fiefs
of
the
German
Kingdom
part
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
except
his
birthplace
of
Flanders
which
was
still
a
French
fief
a
last
remnant
of
what
had
been
a
powerful
player
in
the
Hundred
Years
War
As
he
was
a
minor
his
aunt
Margaret
of
Austria
born
as
Archduchess
of
Austria
and
in
both
her
marriages
as
the
Dowager
Princess
of
Asturias
and
Dowager
Duchess
of
Savoy
acted
as
regent
as
appointed
by
Emperor
Maximilian
until
1515
She
soon
found
herself
at
war
with
France
over
the
question
of
Charles
requirement
to
pay
homage
to
the
French
king
for
Flanders
as
his
father
had
done
The
outcome
was
that
France
relinquished
its
ancient
claim
on
Flanders
in
1528
From
1515
to
1523
Charles
s
government
in
the
Netherlands
also
had
to
contend
with
the
rebellion
of
Frisian
peasants
led
by
Pier
Gerlofs
Donia
and
Wijard
Jelckama
The
rebels
were
initially
successful
but
after
a
series
of
defeats
the
remaining
leaders
were
captured
and
decapitated
in
1523
Charles
extended
the
Burgundian
territory
with
the
annexation
of
Tournai
Artois
Utrecht
Groningen
and
Guelders
The
Seventeen
Provinces
had
been
unified
by
Charles
s
Burgundian
ancestors
but
nominally
were
fiefs
of
either
France
or
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
In
1549
Charles
issued
a
Pragmatic
Sanction
declaring
the
Low
Countries
to
be
a
unified
entity
of
which
his
family
would
be
the
heirs
15
The
Low
Countries
held
an
important
place
in
the
Empire
For
Charles
V
personally
they
were
his
home
the
region
where
he
was
born
and
spent
his
childhood
Because
of
trade
and
industry
and
the
wealth
of
the
region
s
cities
the
Low
Countries
also
represented
an
important
income
for
the
Imperial
treasury
The
Burgundian
territories
were
generally
loyal
to
Charles
throughout
his
reign
The
important
city
of
Ghent
rebelled
in
1539
due
to
heavy
tax
payments
demanded
by
Charles
The
rebellion
did
not
last
long
however
as
Charles
s
military
response
with
reinforcement
from
the
Duke
of
Alba
15
was
swift
and
humiliating
to
the
rebels
of
Ghent

In
the
Castilian
Cortes
of
Valladolid
in
1506
and
of
Madrid
in
1510
Charles
was
sworn
as
the
Prince
of
Asturias
heir
apparent
to
his
mother
the
Queen
Joanna
20
On
the
other
hand
in
1502
the
Aragonese
Corts
gathered
in
Saragossa
and
pledged
an
oath
to
Joanna
as
heiress
presumptive
but
the
Archbishop
of
Saragossa
expressed
firmly
that
this
oath
could
not
establish
jurisprudence
that
is
to
say
modify
the
right
of
the
succession
except
by
virtue
of
a
formal
agreement
between
the
Cortes
and
the
King
21
22
So
upon
the
death
of
King
Ferdinand
II
of
Aragon
on
23
January
1516
Joanna
inherited
the
Crown
of
Aragon
which
consisted
of
Catalonia
Valencia
Naples
Sicily
and
Sardinia
while
Charles
became
Governor
General
23
Nevertheless
the
Flemings
wished
Charles
to
assume
the
royal
title
citation
needed
and
this
was
supported
by
his
grandfather
the
emperor
Maximilian
I
and
Pope
Leo
X
Thus
after
the
celebration
of
Ferdinand
II
s
obsequies
on
14
March
1516
Charles
was
proclaimed
king
of
the
crowns
of
Castile
and
Aragon
jointly
with
his
mother
Finally
when
the
Castilian
regent
Cardinal
Jim
nez
de
Cisneros
accepted
the
fait
accompli
he
acceded
to
Charles
s
desire
to
be
proclaimed
king
and
imposed
his
enstatement
throughout
the
kingdom
24
Charles
arrived
in
his
new
kingdoms
in
autumn
of
1517
Jim
nez
de
Cisneros
came
to
meet
him
but
fell
ill
along
the
way
not
without
a
suspicion
of
poison
and

before
meeting

Due
to
the
irregularity
of
Charles
assuming
the
royal
title
while
his
mother
the
legitimate
queen
was
alive
the
negotiations
with
the
Castilian
Cortes
in
Valladolid
1518
proved
difficult
26
In
the
end
Charles
was
accepted
under
the
following
conditions
he
would
learn
to
speak
Castilian
he
would
not
appoint
foreigners
he
was
prohibited
from
taking
precious
metals
from
Castile
and
he
would
respect
the
rights
of
his
mother
Queen
Joanna
The
Cortes
paid
homage
to
him
in
Valladolid
in
February
1518
After
this
Charles
departed
to
the
crown
of
Aragon
He
managed
to
overcome
the
resistance
of
the
Aragonese
Cortes
and
Catalan
Corts
27
and
he
was
finally
recognized
as
king
of
Aragon
and
count
of
Barcelona
jointly
with
his
mother
28
The
Kingdom
of
Navarre
had
been
invaded
by
Ferdinand
of
Aragon
jointly
with
Castile
in
1512
but
he
pledged
a
formal
oath
to
respect
the
kingdom
On
Charles
s
accession
to
the
Spanish
throne
the
Parliament
of
Navarre
Cortes
required
him
to
attend
the
coronation
ceremony
to
become
Charles
IV
of
Navarre
but
this
demand
fell
on
deaf
ears
and
the
Parliament
kept
piling
up
grievances
Charles
was
accepted
as
sovereign
even
though
the
Spanish
felt
uneasy
with
the
Imperial
style
Spanish
kingdoms
varied
in
their
traditions
Castile
was
an
authoritarian
kingdom
where
the
monarch
s
own
will
easily
overrode
law
and
the
Cortes
By
contrast
in
the
kingdoms
of
the
crown
of
Aragon
and
especially
in
the
Pyrenean
kingdom
of
Navarre
law
prevailed
and
the
monarchy
was
a
contract
with
the
people
This
became
an
inconvenience
and
a
matter
of
dispute
for
Charles
V
and
later
kings
since
realm
specific
traditions
limited
their
absolute
power
With
Charles
government
became
more
absolute
even
though
until
his
mother
s
death
in
1555
Charles
did
not
hold
the
full
kingship
of
the
country
Soon
resistance
to
the
Emperor
arose
because
of
heavy
taxation
to
support
foreign
wars
in
which
Castilians
had
little
interest
and
because
Charles
tended
to
select
Flemings
for
high
offices
in
Spain
and
America
ignoring
Castilian
candidates
The
resistance
culminated
in
the
Revolt
of
the
Comuneros
which
Charles
suppressed
Immediately
after
crushing
the
Castilian
revolt
Charles
was
confronted
again
with
the
hot
issue
of
Navarre
when
King
Henry
II
attempted
to
reconquer
the
kingdom
Main
military
operations
lasted
until
1524
when
Hondarribia
surrendered
to
Charles
s
forces
but
frequent
cross
border
clashes
in
the
western
Pyrenees
only
stopped
in
1528
Treaties
of
Madrid
and
Cambrai
After
these
events
Navarre
remained
a
matter
of
domestic
and
international
litigation
still
for
a
century
a
French
dynastic
claim
to
the
throne
did
not
end
until
the
French
Revolution
in
1789
Charles
wanted
his
son
and
heir
Philip
II
to
marry
the
heiress
of
Navarre
Jeanne
d
Albret
Jeanne
was
instead
forced
to
marry
William
Duke
of
Julich
Cleves
Berg
but
that
childless
marriage
was
annulled
after
four
years
She
next
married
Antoine
de
Bourbon
and
both
she
and
their
son
would
oppose
Philip
II
in
the
French
Wars
of
Religion
Castile
became
integrated
into
Charles
s
empire
and
provided
the
bulk
of
the
empire
s
financial
resources
as
well
as
its
most
effective
military
units
The
enormous
budget
deficit
accumulated
during
Charles
s
reign
resulted
in
Spain
declaring
bankruptcy
during
the
reign
of
Philip
II
29

The
Crown

Charles
included

Kingdom

the
Kingdom

and

Kingdom

Aragon
also
previously
controlled
the
Duchy
of
Milan
but
a
year
before
Charles
ascended
to
the
throne
it
was
annexed
by
France
after
the
Battle
of
Marignano
in
1515
Charles
succeeded
in
re
capturing
Milan
in
1522
when
Imperial
troops
defeated
the
Franco
Swiss
army
at
Bicocca
Yet
in
1524
Francis
I
of
France
retook
the
initiative
crossing
into
Lombardy

Milan
along
with
a
number
of
other
cities
once
again
fell
to

attack

on
24

Charles
s
Spanish
forces
captured

successfully
held
on
to
all
of
its
Italian
territories
though
they
were
invaded
again
on
multiple
occasions
during
the
Italian
Wars
In
addition
Habsburg
trade
in
the
Mediterranean
was
consistently
disrupted
by
the
Ottoman
Empire
In
1538
a
Holy
League
consisting
of
all
the
Italian
states
and
Spain
was
formed
to
drive
the
Ottomans
back
but
it
was
defeated
at
the
Battle
of
Preveza
Decisive
naval
victory
eluded
Charles
it
would
not
be
achieved
until
after
Charles
s
death
at
the
Battle
of
Lepanto
in
1571
America
edit
During
Charles
s
reign
the
Spanish
territories
in
the
Americas
were
considerably
extended
by
conquistadores
like
Hern
n
Cort
s
and
Francisco
Pizarro
They
conquered
the
large
Aztec
and
Inca
empires
and
incorporated
them
into
the
Empire
as
the
Viceroyalties
of
New
Spain
and
Peru
between
1519
and
1542
Combined
with
the
circumnavigation
of
the
globe
by
the
Magellan
expedition
in
1522
these
successes
convinced
Charles
of
his
divine
mission
to
become
the
leader
of
Christendom
which
still
perceived
a
significant
threat
from
Islam
The
conquests
also
helped
solidify
Charles
s
rule
by
providing
the
state
treasury
with
enormous
amounts
of
bullion
As
the
conquistador
Bernal
D
az
del
Castillo
observed
We
came
to
serve
God
and
his
Majesty
to
give
light
to
those
in
darkness
and
also
to
acquire
that
wealth
which
most
men
covet
30
In
1528
Charles
assigned
a
concession
in
Venezuela
Province
to
Bartholomeus
V
Welser
in
compensation
for
his
inability
to
repay
debts
owed
The
concession
known
as
Klein
Venedig
little
Venice
was
revoked
in
1546
In
1550
Charles
convened
a
conference
at
Valladolid
in
order
to
consider
the
morality
of
the
force
used
against
the
indigenous
populations
of
the
New
World
which
included
figures
such
as
Bartolom
de
las
Casas
Charles
V
is
credited
with
the
first
idea
of
constructing
an
American
Isthmus

After
the
death

Charles
inherited

He
was

Despite
holding
the
imperial
throne
Charles
s
real
authority
was
limited
by
the
German
princes
They
gained
a
strong
foothold
in
the
Empire
s
territories
and
Charles
was
determined
not
to
let
this
happen
in
the
Netherlands
An
inquisition
was
established
as
early
as
1522
In
1550
the
death
penalty
was
introduced
for
all
cases
of
unrepentant
heresy
Political
dissent
was
also
firmly
controlled
most
notably
in
his
place
of
birth
where
Charles
assisted
by
the
Duke
of
Alba
personally
suppressed
the
Revolt
of
Ghent
in
mid
February
1540
15
Charles
abdicated
as
emperor
in
1556
in
favor
of
his
brother
Ferdinand
however
due
to
lengthy
debate
and
bureaucratic
procedure
the
Imperial
Diet
did
not
accept
the
abdication
and
thus
make
it
legally
valid
until
24
February
1558
Up
to
that
date
Charles
continued
to
use
the
title
of
emperor

Francis
actually
refused
to

Charles
in
person
and
the
treaty
was
signed
in
separate
rooms
Much
of
Charles
s
reign
was
taken
up
by
conflicts
with
France
which
found
itself
encircled
by
Charles
s
empire
while
it
still
maintained
ambitions
in
Italy
In
1520
Charles
visited
England
where
his
aunt
Catherine
of
Aragon
urged
her
husband
Henry
VIII
to
ally
himself
with
the

was
highly
successful
driving
the
French
out
of
Milan
and
defeating
and
capturing
Francis
at
the
Battle
of
Pavia
in
1525
To
gain
his
freedom
Francis
ceded
Burgundy
to
Charles
in
the
Treaty
of
Madrid
as
well
as
renouncing
his
support
of
Henry
II
s
claim
over
Navarre

When
he
was
released
however
Francis
had
the
Parliament
of
Paris
denounce
the
treaty
because
it
had
been
signed
under
duress
France
then
joined
the
League
of
Cognac
that
Pope
Clement
VII
had
formed
with
Henry
VIII
of
England
the
Venetians
the
Florentines
and
the
Milanese
to
resist
imperial
domination
of
Italy
In
the
ensuing
war
Charles
s
sack
of
Rome
1527
and
virtual
imprisonment
of
Pope
Clement
VII
in
1527
prevented
the
Pope
from
annulling
the
marriage
of
Henry
VIII
of
England
and
Charles
s
aunt
Catherine
of
Aragon
so
Henry
eventually
broke
with
Rome
thus
leading
to
the
English
Reformation
35
36
In
other
respects
the
war
was
inconclusive
In
the
Treaty
of
Cambrai
1529
called
the
Ladies
Peace
because
it
was
negotiated
between
Charles
s
aunt
and
Francis
mother
Francis
renounced
his
claims
in
Italy
but
retained
control
of
Burgundy
A
third
war
erupted
in
1536
Following
the
death
of
the
last
Sforza
Duke
of
Milan
Charles
installed
his
son
Philip
in
the
duchy
despite
Francis
s
claims
on
it
This
war
too
was
inconclusive
Francis
failed
to
conquer
Milan
but
he
succeeded
in
conquering
most
of
the
lands
of
Charles
s
ally
the
Duke
of
Savoy
including
his
capital
Turin
A

at
Nice
in
1538
on
the
basis
of

ended
the
war
but
lasted
only
a
short
time
War
resumed
in
1542
with
Francis
now
allied
with
Ottoman
Sultan
Suleiman
I
and
Charles
once
again
allied
with
Henry
VIII
Despite
the
conquest
of
Nice
by
a
Franco
Ottoman
fleet
the
French
could
not
advance
toward
Milan
while
a
joint
Anglo
Imperial
invasion
of
northern
France
led
by
Charles
himself
won
some
successes
but
was
ultimately
abandoned
leading
to
another
peace
and
restoration
of
the
status
quo
ante
bellum
in
1544
A
final
war
erupted
with
Francis
son
and
successor
Henry
II
in
1551
Henry
won
early
success
in
Lorraine
where
he
captured
Metz
but
French
offensives
in
Italy
failed
Charles
abdicated
midway
through
this
conflict

in

Charles
called

to
the
Diet
of
Worms
in
1521
promising
him
safe
conduct
if
he
would
appear
Initially
dismissing
Luther
s
theses
as
an
argument
between
monks
he
later
outlawed
Luther
and
his
followers
in
that

year
but
was
tied
up
with
other
concerns
and
unable
to
take
action
against
Protestantism
The

broke
out
from
1524
to
1526
and
in

the

Charles
delegated
increasing

the
year
of

s
natural
death
he
outlawed
the
Schmalkaldic
League
which
had
occupied
the
territory
of
another

The
next
year
his
forces
drove
the
League
s
troops
out
of
southern
Germany
and
defeated
John
Frederick
Elector
of
Saxony
and
Philip

At

he
created
a

giving
certain
allowances
to
Protestants
until
the
Council

would
restore
unity
However
members
of
both
sides
resented

Interim
and
some
actively
opposed
it
In

Protestant
princes

Marriage
edit
During
his
lifetime
Charles
had
several
mistresses
but
only
during
his
bachelorhood
and
only
once
during
his
widowhood
there
are
no
records
of
him
ever
having
had
any
extramarital
affairs
during
his
marriage
Negotiations
for
Charles
s
marriage
first
began
shortly
after
his
arrival
in
Spain
with
the
Spanish
nobles
expressing
their
wishes
for
him
to
marry
his
first
cousin
the
Infanta
Isabella
of
Portugal
daughter
of
King
Manuel
I
of
Portugal
and
Queen
Maria
of
Aragon
and
sister
of
King
John
III
of
Portugal
The
nobles
desired
for
Charles
to
marry
a
princess
of
Spanish
blood
and
a
marriage
to
Isabella
would
secure
an
alliance
between
Spain
and
Portugal
The
18
year
old
king
however
ignored
the
nobles
advice
and
instead
of
marrying
Isabella
he
sent
his
sister
Eleanor
of
Austria
to
marry
Isabella
s
widowed
father
King
Manuel
In
1521
on
the
advice
of
his
Flemish
advisors
Charles
became
engaged
to
his
other
first
cousin
Mary
Tudor
daughter
of
his
aunt
Katherine
of
Aragon
and
King
Henry
VIII
of
England
in
order
to
secure
an
alliance
with
England
However
this
engagement
was
very
problematic
Mary
Tudor
was
only
6
years
old
at
the
time
sixteen
years
Charles
s
junior
which
meant
that
Charles
would
have
to
wait
for
her
to
be
old
enough
to
marry
By
1525
Charles
was
no
longer
interested
in
an
alliance
with
England
and
was
determined
to
have
legitimate
children
and
heirs
He
abandoned
idea
of
an
alliance
with
England
cancelled
his
engagement
to
Mary
Tudor
and
decided
to
marry
Isabella
and
form
an
alliance
with
Portugal
Charles
wrote
to
King
John
making
a
double
marriage
contract
Charles
would
marry
Isabella
and
John
would
marry
Charles
s
youngest
sister
Catherine
of
Austria
A
marriage
to
Isabella
was
more
beneficiary
for
Charles
as
she
was
closer
to
him
in
age
and
provided
him
with
a
very
handsome
dowry
of
900
000
Portuguese
cruzados
or
Castilian
folds
that
would
solve
his
financial
problems
brought
on
by
the
Italian
Wars
Emperor
Charles
V
and
Empress
Isabella

17th
century
On
11
March
1526
Charles
and
Isabella
were
married
at
the
Alc
zar
Palace
in
Seville
The
marriage
was
originally
a
political
arrangement
but
on
their
first
meeting
the
couple
fell
deeply
in
love
with
Isabella
captivating
the
Emperor
with
her
beauty
and
charm
Following
their
wedding
Charles
and
Isabella
spent
a
long
and
happy
honeymoon
at
the
Alhambra
in
Granada
Despite
the
Emperor
s
long
absences
due
to
political
affairs
abroad
the
marriage
was
a
happy
one
as
both
partners
were
always
devoted
and
faithful
to
each
other
42
The
Empress
would
act
as
regent
of
Spain
during
her
husband
s
absences
and
she
proved
herself
to
be
a
good
politician
and
ruler
The
marriage
lasted
for
thirteen
years
until
Isabella
died
in
childbirth
at
the
age
of
35
on
1
May
1539
after
giving
birth
to
a
stillborn
son
The
Emperor
was
left
so
grief
stricken
by
his
wife
s
death
that
he
shut
himself
up
in
a
monastery
for
two
months
where
he
would
pray
and
mourn
for
her
43
In
the
aftermath
Charles
never
recovered
from
the
loss
he
dressed
in
black
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
unlike
most
kings
of
the
time
he
never
remarried
In
memory
of
his
wife
Charles
commissioned
the
painter
Titian
to
paint
several
posthumous
portraits
of
Isabella
the
portraits
that
were
produced
included
Titian
s
Portrait
of
Empress
Isabel
of
Portugal
and
La
Gloria
44
Charles
kept
these
portraits
with
him
whenever
he
travelled
and
they
were
among
those
that
he
brought
with
him
to
the
Monastery
of
Yuste
after
his
retirement
45
Charles
also
paid
tribute
to
Isabella
s
memory
with
music
when
in
1540
he
commissioned
the
Flemish
composer
Thomas
Crecquillon
to
compose
new
music
as
a
memorial
to
her
Crecquillon
composed
his
Missa
Mort
m
a
priv
in
memory
of
the
Empress
which
itself
expresses
the
Emperor
s
grief
and
great
wish
for
a
heavenly
reunion
with
his
beloved
wife
46
Health
edit
Charles
suffered
from
an
enlarged
lower
jaw
a
deformity
that
became
considerably
worse
in
later
Habsburg
generations
giving
rise
to
the
term
Habsburg
jaw
This
deformity
may
have
been
caused
by
the
family
s
long
history
of
inbreeding
which
was
commonly
practiced
in
royal
families
of
that
era
to
maintain
dynastic
control
of
territory
citation

He
suffered
from
epilepsy
47
and
was
seriously
afflicted
with
gout
presumably
caused
by
a
diet
consisting
mainly
of
red
meat
48
As
he
aged
his
gout
progressed
from
painful
to
crippling
In
his
retirement
he
was
carried
around
the
monastery
of
St
Yuste
in
a
sedan
chair
A
ramp
was
specially
constructed
to
allow
him

Charles
abdicated
the
parts
of
his
empire
piecemeal
First
he
abdicated
the
thrones
of
Sicily
and
Naples
both
fiefs
of
the
Papacy
and
the
Duchy
of
Milan
to
his
son
Philip
in
1554
Upon
Charles
s
abdication
of
Naples
on
25
July
Philip
was
invested
with
the
kingdom
officially
Naples
and
Sicily
on
2
October
by
Pope
Julius
III
The
abdication
of
the
throne
of
Sicily
sometimes
dated
to
16
January
1556
must
have
taken
place
before
Joanna
s
death
in
1555
There
is
a
record
of
Philip
being
invested
with
this
kingdom
officially
Sicily
and
Jerusalem
on
18
November
1554
by
Julius
These
resignations
are
confirmed
in
Charles
s
will
from
the
same
year
50
The
most
famous
and
public
abdication
of
Charles
took
place
a
year
later
on
25
October
1555
when
he
announced
to
the
States
General
of
the
Netherlands
his
abdication
of
those
territories
and
the
county
of
Charolais
and
his
intention
to
retire
to
a
monastery
50
He
abdicated
as
ruler
of
the
Spanish
Empire
in
January
1556
with
no
fanfare
and
gave
these
possessions
to
Philip
50
In
September
1556
he
abdicated
as
Holy
Roman
Emperor
in
favor
of
his
brother
Ferdinand
although
the
abdication
was
not
formally
accepted
by
the
Electors
of
the
Empire
until
1558
51
The
delay
had
been
at
the
request
of
Ferdinand
who
had
been
concerned
about
holding
a
risky
election
in
1556
50
Charles
retired
to
the
Monastery
of
Yuste
in
Extremadura
but
continued
to
correspond
widely
and
kept
an
interest
in
the
situation
of
the
empire
He
suffered
from
severe
gout
Some
scholars
think
Charles
decided
to
abdicate
after
a
gout
attack
in
1552
forced
him
to
postpone
an
attempt
to
recapture
the
city
of
Metz
where
he
was
later
defeated
He
lived
alone
in
a
secluded
monastery
with
clocks
lining
every
wall
which
some
historians
believe
were
symbols
of
his
reign
and
his
lack
of
time

ill
with
what
was

revealed
to
be
malaria

He
died
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
on
21st

at
the
age

58
holding
in
his
hand
the
cross
that
his
wife
Isabella
had
been
holding
when
she
died
54
Charles
was
originally
buried
in
the
chapel
of
the
Monastery
of
Yuste
but
he
left
a
codicil
in
his
last
will
and
testament
asking
for
the
establishment
of
a
new
religious
foundation
in
which
he
would
be
reburied
with
Isabella
55
Following
his
return
to
Spain
in
1559
their
son
Philip
undertook
the
task
of
fulfilling
his
father
s
wish
when
he
founded
the
Monastery
of
San
Lorenzo
de

After
the
Monastery
s
Royal
Crypt
was
completed
in
1574
the
bodies
of
Charles
and
Isabella
were
relocated
and
re
interred
into
a
small
vault
directly
underneath
the
altar
of
the
famous
Basilica
of
the
Monastery
in

to
be
buried
half

Pantheon
of
Kings
by

The

established
the
principle

allowed
the
princes
of
states
within
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
to
adopt
either
Lutheranism
or
Catholicism
within
the

they
controlled
ultimately
reaffirming
their
sovereignty
over
those
domains
Subjects

or
residents
who
did
not
wish
to

were
given

Charles
V
had
made
an
interim
ruling
the
Augsburg
Interim
of
1548
on
the
legitimacy
of
two
religious
creeds
in
the
empire
and
this
was
codified
in
law
on
30
June
1548
upon
the
insistence
of
Charles
V
who
wanted
to
work
out
religious
differences
under
the
auspices
of
a
general
council
of
the
Catholic
Church
The
Interim
largely
reflected
principles
of
religious
behavior
in
its
26
articles
although
it
allowed
for
marriage
of
the
clergy
and
the
giving
of
both
bread
and
wine
to
the
laity
This
led
to
resistance
by
the
Protestant
territories
who
proclaimed
their
own
Interim
at
Leipzig
the
following
year
2
The
Interim
was
overthrown
in
1552
by
the
revolt
of
the
Protestant
elector
Maurice
of
Saxony
and
his
allies
In
the
negotiations
at
Passau
in
the
summer
of
1552
even
the
Catholic
princes
had
called
for
a
lasting
peace
fearing
the
religious
controversy
would
never
be
settled
The
emperor
however
was
unwilling
to
recognize
the
religious
division
in
Western
Christendom
as
permanent
This
document
was
foreshadowed
by
the
Peace
of
Passau
which
in
1552
gave
Lutherans
religious
freedom
after
a
victory
by
Protestant
armies
Under
the
Passau
document
Charles
granted
a
peace
only
until
the
next
imperial
Diet
whose
meeting
was
called
in
early
1555
The
treaty
negotiated
on
Charles
behalf
by
his
brother
Ferdinand
effectively
gave
Lutheranism
official
status
within
the
domains
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
according
to
the
policy
of
cuius
regio
eius
religio
Knights
and
towns
who
had
practiced
Lutheranism
for
some
time
were
exempted
under
the
Declaratio
Ferdinandei
but
the
Ecclesiastical
reservation
supposedly
prevented
the
principle
of
cuius
regio
eius
religio
from
being
applied
if
an
ecclesiastical
ruler
converted
to
Lutheranism
Main
principles
edit
The
Peace
of
Augsburg
contained
three
main
principles
3
The
principle
of
cuius
regio
eius
religio
Whose
realm
his
religion
provided
for
internal
religious
unity
within
a
state
the
religion
of
the
prince
became
the
religion
of
the
state
and
all
its
inhabitants
Those
inhabitants
who
could
not
conform
to
the
prince
s
religion
were
allowed
to
leave
an
innovative
idea
in
the
16th
century
This
principle
was
discussed
at
length
by
the
various
delegates
who
finally
reached
agreement
on
the
specifics
of
its
wording
after
examining
the
problem
and
the
proposed
solution
from
every
possible
angle
4
The
second
principle
called
the
reservatum
ecclesiasticum
ecclesiastical
reservation
covered
the
special
status
of
the
ecclesiastical
state
If
the
prelate
of
an
ecclesiastic
state
changed
his
religion
the
inhabitants
of
that
state
did
not
have
to
do
so
Instead
the
prelate
was
expected
to
resign
from
his
post
although
this
was
not
spelled
out
in
the
agreement
5
The
third
principle
known
as
Declaratio
Ferdinandei
Ferdinand
s
Declaration
exempted
knights
and
some
of
the
cities
from
the
requirement
of
religious
uniformity
if
the
reformed
religion
had
been
practiced
there
since
the
mid
1520s
This
allowed
for
a
few
mixed
cities
and
towns
where
Catholics
and
Lutherans
had
lived
together
It
also
protected
the
authority
of
the
princely
families
the
knights
and
some
of
the
cities
to
determine
what
religious
uniformity
meant
in
their
territories
Ferdinand
inserted
this
at
the
last
minute
on
his
own
authority
6
The
third
principle
exempted
knights
and
some
of
the
cities
under
the
jurisdiction
of
an
ecclesiastical
prince
if
they
had
practiced
Lutheranism
for
some
time
Lutheranism
was
the
only
branch
of
Protestantism
recognized
under
the
Peace
The
provision
was
not
publicized
as
part
of
the
treaty
and
was
kept
secret
for
almost
two
decades
7
Problems
edit
The
document
itself
had
critical
problems
While
it
gave
legal
basis
for
the
practice
of
the
Lutheran
confession
it
did
not
accept
any
of
the
Reformed
traditions
such
as
Calvinism
nor
did
it
recognize
Anabaptism
Although
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
was
moderately
successful
in
relieving
tension
in
the
empire
and
increasing
tolerance
it
left
important
things
undone
Neither
the
Anabaptists
nor
the
Calvinists
were
protected
under
the
peace
so
many
Protestant
groups
living
under
the
rule
of
a
Lutheran
prince
still
found
themselves
in
danger
of
the
charge
of
heresy
Article
17
However
all
such
as
do
not
belong
to
the
two
above
named
religions
shall
not
be
included
in
the
present
peace
but
be
totally
excluded
from
it
These
minorities
did
not
achieve
any
legal
recognition
until
the
Peace
of
Westphalia
in
1648
The
intolerance
towards
Calvinists
caused
them
to
take
desperate
measures
that
led
to
the
Thirty
Years
War
One
of
the
more
notable
measures
was
the
Second
Defenestration
of
Prague
1618
in
which
two
representatives
of
the
fiercely
Catholic
Holy
Roman
Emperor
Ferdinand
II
were
thrown
out
of
a
castle
window
in
Prague
Aftermath
edit
The
principle
of
ecclesiastical
reservation
was
tested
in
the
Cologne
War
1583
1588
which
grew
out
of
the
scenario
envisioned
by
Ferdinand
when
he
wrote
the
proviso
the
reigning
Prince
Bishop
converted
to
Protestantism
although
he
did
not
insist
that
the
population
convert
he
placed
Calvinism
on
a
parity
with
Catholicism
throughout
the
Electorate
of
Cologne
This
in
itself
created
a
two
fold
legal
problem
first
Calvinism
was
considered
a
heresy
second
the
Elector
did
not
resign
his
see
which
made
him
eligible
at
least
in
theory
to
cast
a
ballot
for
emperor
Finally
his
marriage
posed
a
very
real
potential
to
convert
the
Electorate
into
a
dynastic
principality
shifting
the
balance
of
religious
power
in
the
Empire
A
side
effect
of
the
religious
turmoil
was
Charles
decision
to
abdicate
and
divide
Habsburg
territory
into
two
sections
His
brother
Ferdinand
ruled
the
Austrian
lands
and
Charles
fervently
Catholic
son
Philip
II
became
administrator
of
Spain
the
Spanish
Netherlands
parts
of
Italy
and
other
overseas
holdings

The
SMART
System
for
the
Mechanical
Analysis
and
Retrieval
of
Text
Information
Retrieval
System
is
an
information
retrieval
system
developed
at
Cornell
University
in
the
1960s
Many
important
concepts
in
information
retrieval
were
developed
as
part
of
research
on
the
SMART
system
including
the
vector
space
model
relevance
feedback
and
Rocchio
classification
Gerard
Salton
led
the
group
that
developed
SMART
Other
contributors
included
Mike
Lesk
The
SMART
system
also
provides
a
set
of
corpora
queries
and
reference
rankings
taken
from
different
subjects
notably
ADI
publications
from
information

of

To
the
legacy
of
the
SMART
system
belongs
the
so
called
SMART
notation
a
mnemonic
scheme
for
denoting
tf
idf
weighting
variants
in
the
vector
space
model
The
mnemonic
for
representing
a
combination
of

takes
the
form
ddd
qqq
where
the
first
three
letters
represents
the
term

of

The
Bishops
of
Bamberg
received
the
princely
title
by
Emperor
Frederick
II
of
Hohenstaufen
before
his
deposition
by
Pope
Innocent
IV
in
1245
whereby
the
diocese
became
an
Imperial
state
During
the
18th
century
it
was
often
held
in
conjunction
with
the
neighboring
Bishopric
of
W
rzburg
Bamberg
was
bordered
among
others
by
W
rzburg
to
the
west
by
the
Margraviate
of
Brandenburg
Ansbach
and
the
Free
City
of
Nuremberg
to
the
south
by
the
Margraviate
of
Brandenburg
Bayreuth
to
the
east
and
by
the
Duchy
of
Saxe
Coburg
to
the
north

The
prince
bishopric
also
ruled
over
large
possessions
within
the
Duchy
of
Carinthia
including
the
strategically
important
towns
of
Villach
Feldkirchen
Wolfsberg
and
Tarvisio
at
the
transalpine
road
to
Venice
as
well
as
Kirchdorf
an
der
Krems
in
the
Archduchy
of
Austria
The
Habsburg
Empress
Maria
Theresa
purchased
these
territories
in
1759
In
the
course
of
the
German
Mediatization
of
1802
3
which
saw
the
suppression
of
virtually
all
the
ecclesiastical
principalities
Bamberg
was
annexed
to
Bavaria
The
former
prince

then
had
an
area
of
3
580
km
and
a
population
of
207
000
History
edit
Beginning
on
1
November
1007
a
synod
was
held
in
the
city
of
Frankfurt
am
Main
Eight
archbishops
and
twenty
seven
bishops
were
present
led
by
Archbishop
Willigis
of
Mainz
as
well
as
the
King
of
the
Romans
Heinrich
II
Henry
II
The
king
intended
to
create
a
new
diocese
that
would
aid
in
the
final
conquest
of
paganism
in
the
area
around
Bamberg
But
the
territory
of
the
Wends
on
the
upper
Main
the
Wiesent
and
the
Aisch
had
belonged
to
the
Diocese
of
W
rzburg
since
the
organization
of
the
Middle
German
bishoprics
by
St
Boniface
so
that
no
new
diocese
could
be
erected
without
the
consent
of
the
occupant
of
that
see
Bishop
Henry
I
of
W
rzburg
was
willing
to
go
along
with
parting
with
some
of
his
territory
as
the
king
promised
to
have
W
rzburg
raised
to
an
archbishopric
and
to
give
him
an
equivalent
in
Meiningen
The
consent
of
Pope
John
XVII
was
obtained
for
this
arrangement
but
the
elevation
of
W
rzburg
to
an
archbishopric
proved
impracticable
also
due
to
Willigis
reservations
and
Bishop
Henry
I
at
first
withdrew
his
consent

Nevertheless
after
several
further
concessions
King
Heinrich
II
obtained
the
consent
for
the
foundation
of
the
diocese
of
Bamberg
from
parts
of
the
dioceses
of
W
rzburg
and
later
the
Diocese
of
Eichst
tt
Bamberg
was
made
directly
subordinate
to
Rome
It
was
also
decided
that
Eberhard
the
king
s
chancellor
would
be
ordained
by
Archbishop
Willigis
of
Mainz
to
be
the
head
of
the
new
border
area
diocese
The
new
diocese
had
expensive
gifts
at
the
synod
confirmed
by
documents
in
order
to
place
it
on
a
solid
foundation
Henry
wanted
the
celebrated
monkish
rigour
and
studiousness
of
the
Hildesheim
cathedral
chapter
Henry
himself
was
educated
there
linked
together
with
the
churches
under
his
control
including
his
favourite
bishopric
of
Bamberg
The
next
seven
bishops
were
named
by
the
emperors
after
which
election
by
the
cathedral
chapter
became
the
rule
as
in
all
the
German
prince
bishoprics
Eberhard
s
immediate
successor
Suidger
of
Morsleben
became
pope
in
1046
as
Clement
II
He
was
the
only
pope
to
be
interred
north
of
the
Alps
at
the
Bamberg
Cathedral
In
the
thirteenth
century
the
diocese
gradually
became
a
territorial
principality
and
its
bishops
took
secular
precedence
next
after
the
archbishops
Bishop
Henry
I
of
Bilversheim
1242
57
became
the
first
Prince
Bishop
The
fortieth
bishop
George
III
of
Limburg
1505
22
was
inclined
toward
the
Reformation
which
caused
a
violent
social
outbreak
under
his
successor
Weigand
1522
56
and
the
city
suffered
severely
in
the
Second
Margrave
War
1552
54
as
well
as
in
the
Thirty
Years
War
when
it
was
placed
under
the
jurisdiction
of
Bernard
the
new
Duke
of
Franconia
At
the
Peace
of
Westphalia
1648
the
prince
bishops
recovered
their
possessions
During
the
French
Revolution
Bamberg
was
overrun
by
the
French
and
in
the
course
of
the
German
mediatization
of
1802
3
it
was
annexed
to
Bavaria
From
1808
to
1817
the
See
was
vacant
but
by
the
Bavarian
Concordat
of
the
latter
year
it
was
made
an
archbishopric

W

The

Katholische

was
a
coalition
of
Catholic
states
of
the
Holy

Empire
formed
10
July
1609
While
initially
formed
as
a
confederation
to
act
politically
to
negotiate
issues
vis
vis
the
Protestant
Union
formed
1608
modelled
on
the
more
intransigent
ultra
Catholic
French
Catholic
League
1576
it
was
subsequently
concluded
as
a
military
alliance
for
the
defence
of
the
Catholic
religion
and
peace
within
the
Empire
Notwithstanding
the
league
s
founding
as
had
the
founding
of
the
Protestant
Union
it
further
exacerbated
long
standing
tensions
between
the
Protestant
reformers
and
the
adherents
of
the
Catholic
Church
which
thereafter
began
to
get
worse
with
ever
more
frequent
episodes
of
civil
disobedience
repression
and
retaliation
that
would
eventually
ignite
into
the
first
phase
of
the
Thirty

War
roughly
a
decade
later
with
the
act

Background
edit
In
1555
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
was
signed
which
confirmed
the
result
of
the
Diet
of
Speyer
1526
and
ended
the
violence
between
the
Catholics
and
the
Lutherans
in
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
It
stated
that
Princes
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
numbering
225
could
choose
the
religion
Catholicism
or
Lutheranism
for
their
realms
according
to
their
conscience
the
principle
of
cuius
regio
eius
religio
Lutherans
living
in
an
ecclesiastical
state
under
the
control
of
a
Catholic
prince
bishop
could
remain
Lutherans
Lutherans
could
keep
the
territory
that
they
had
captured
from
the
Catholic
Church
since
the
Peace
of
Passau
1552
The
ecclesiastical
leaders
of
the
Catholic
Church
bishops
that
converted
to
Lutheranism
had
to
give
up
their
territory
the
principle
called
reservatum
ecclesiasticum
Those
occupying
a
state
that
had
officially
chosen
either
Catholicism
or
Lutheranism
could
not
practice
the
religion
differing
to
that
of
the
state
Although
the
Peace
created
a
temporary
end
to
hostilities
the
underlying
bases
of
the
religious
conflict
remained
unsolved
Both
parties
interpreted
it
at
their
convenience
the
Lutherans
in
particular
considering
it
only
a
momentary
agreement
Further
Calvinism
spread
quickly
throughout
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
adding
a
third
major
Christian
worldview
to
the
region
but
its
position
was
not
supported
in
any
way
by
the
Augsburg
terms
since
Catholicism
and
Lutheranism
were
the
only
permitted
creeds
The
foundation
of
the
Catholic
League
edit
Painting
by
Karl
von
Piloty
showing
the
foundation
of
the
Catholic
League
The
best
documented
reason
of
the
foundation
of
the
Catholic
League
was
an
incident
in
the
town
of
Donauw
rth
a
Free
Imperial
City
within
the
territory
of
Bavaria
On
25
April
1606
the
Lutheran
majority
of
the
town
barred
the
Catholic
residents
of
the
town
from
holding
an
annual
Markus
procession
to
show
the
rule
of
their
confession
over
the
town
The
Catholics
led
by
five
monks
wanted
to
pass
through
the
town
and
on
to
the
nearby
village
of

showing
their
flags
and
singing
hymns
They
were
permitted
to
do
so
by
the
terms
of
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
The
city
council
would
only
allow
them
to
re
enter
town
without
flags
and
singing
The
conflict
ended
in
a
brawl
On
protest
of
the
bishop
of
Augsburg
Catholic
Emperor
Rudolf
II
of
Habsburg
threatened
an
Imperial
ban
in
case
of
further
violation
of
the
rights
of
the
Catholic
citizens
Nevertheless
next
year
similar
anti
Catholic
incidents
of
civil
disobedience
took
place
and
the
participants
of
the
Markus
procession
were
thrown
out
of
town
Emperor
Rudolf
then
declared
an
Imperial
ban
on
the
town
and
ordered
Maximilian
I
Duke
of
Bavaria
to
execute
the
ban
Facing
his
army
the
town
surrendered
According
to
Imperial
law
the
disciplinary
measures
should
not
have
been
executed
by
the
Catholic
duke
of
Bavaria
but
by
the
Protestant
duke
of
W
rttemberg
who
like
Donauw
rth
was
a
member
of
the
Swabian
Imperial
Circle
Maximilian
de
facto
absorbed
the
former
Free
Imperial
City
which
was
a
violation
of
Imperial
law
as
well
In
the
same
year
the
Catholic
majority
of
the
Reichstag
meeting
in
the
Diet
of
Augsburg
resolved
that
the
renewal
of
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
of
1555
should
be
conditional
on
the
restoration
of
all
church
land
appropriated
since
1552
Acting
on
these
events
the
Protestant
princes
formed
a
military
alliance
on
14
May
1608
the
Protestant
Union
whose
leader
was
Frederick
IV
of
Wittelsbach
the
Elector
Palatine
To
create
a
union
of
Catholic
states
as
a
counterpart
to
this
Protestant
Union
early
in
1608
Maximilian
started
negotiations
with
other
Catholic
princes
1
On
5
July
1608
the
spiritual
electors
manifested
a
tendency
in
favour
of
the
confederacy
suggested
by
Maximilian
Opinions
were
even
expressed
as
to
the
size
of
the
confederate
military
forces
to
be
raised
In
July
1609
the
representatives
of
the
Prince
Bishops
of
Augsburg
Constance
Passau
Regensburg
and
W
rzburg
assembled
at
Munich
The
Prince
Archbishop
of
Salzburg
having
shown
disapproval
was
not
invited
and
the
Prince
Bishop
of
Eichst
dt
hesitated
On
10
July
1609
the
participating
states
concluded
an
alliance
for
the
defence
of
the
Catholic
religion
and
peace
within
the
Empire
The
most
important
regulation
of
the
League
was
the
prohibition
of
attacks
on
one
another
Instead
of
fighting
conflicts
had
to
be
decided
by
the
laws
of
the
Empire
or
if
these
failed
to
solve
the
conflict
by
arbitration
within
the
League
Should
one
member
be
attacked
it
had
to
be
helped
with
military
or
alternatively
legal
support
Duke
Maximilian
was
to
be
the
president
and
the
Prince
Bishops
of
Augsburg
Passau
and
W
rzburg
his
councillors
The
League
was
to
continue
for
nine
years
The
Munich
Diet
failed
to
erect
a
substantial
structure
for
the
newly
formed
League
On
18
June
1609
the
Electors
of
Mainz
Cologne
and
Trier
had
proposed
an
army
of
20
000
men
They
had
also
considered
making
Maximilian
president
of
the
alliance
and
on
August
30
they
announced
their
adhesion
to
the
Munich
agreement
provided
that
Maximilian
accepted
the
Elector
of
Mainz
arch
chancellor
of
the
Empire
as
co
president
To
create
a
structure
several
general
meetings
of
the
members
were
arranged
On
10
February
1610
the
representatives
of
all
the
important
Catholic
states
except
for
Austria
and
Salzburg
and
a
great
number
of
the
smaller
ones
met
at
W
rzburg
to
decide
the
organization
funding
and
arming
of
the
League
This
was
the
real
beginning
of
the
Catholic
League
The
Pope
the
Emperor
and
the
King
of
Spain
who
had
been
informed
by
Maximilian
were
all
favorably
disposed
towards
the
undertaking
The
main
problem
of
the
League
was
the
unreadiness
of
its
members
In
April
1610
the
contributions
of
all
its
members
were
not
yet
paid
Maximilian
threatened
to
resign
To
prevent
him
from
doing
so
Spain
which
had
made
the
giving
of
a
subsidy
dependent
on
Austria
s
enrollment
in
the
League
waived
this
condition
and
the
pope
promised
a
further
contribution
The
conduct
of
the
Union
in
the
J
lich
dispute
and
the
warlike
operations
of
the
Union
army
in
Alsace
seemed
to
make
a
battle
between
League
and
Union
inevitable
In
the
year
1613
at
Regensburg
Austria
joined
the
League
The
assembly
now
appointed
no
less
than
three
war
directors
Duke
Maximilian
and
Archdukes
Albert
and
Maximilian
of
Austria
The
object
of
the
League
was
now
declared
a
Christian
legal
defense
The
membership
of
Austria
made
the
League
part
of
the
struggles
between
the
emperor
and
his
Protestant
vassals
in
Bohemia
and
Lower
Austria
that
would
lead
to
the
beginning
of
the
Thirty
Years
War
Maximilian
I
Elector
and
Duke
of
Bavaria
Duke
Maximilian
refused
to
accept
the
resolutions
of
Ratisbon
and
even
resigned
the
post
as
president
when
Archduke
Maximilian
III
of
Austria
the
Prince
Elector
of
Mainz
and
the
Prince
Elector
of
Trier
protested
the
inclusion
of
the
Bishop
of
Augsburg
and
the
Provost
of
Ellwangen
in
the
Bavarian
Directory
On
27
May
1617
with
the
Prince
Bishops
of
Bamberg
Eichst
dt
W
rzburg
and
the
Prince
Provost
of
Ellwangen
Bavaria
formed
a
separate
league
for
nine
years
At
the
end
of
1618
the
position
of
the
Emperor
in
Bohemia
as
in
Lower
and
Upper
Austria
gradually
became
critical
Searching
for
help
the
Emperor
tried
to
restore
the
League
A
meeting
of
several
of
the
ecclesiastical
Princes
decided
to
reconstruct
the
League
on
its
original
basis
It
would
consist
of
two
groups
the
Rhenish
district
under
the
presidency
of
Mainz
and
the
Oberland
district
presided
by
Bavaria
the
treasury
and
the
military
command
were
to
be
considered
separate
Maximilian
could
only
lead
the
whole
of
the
troops
when
he
had
to
appear
in
the
Rhenish
district
On
31
May
the
Oberland
both
groups
were
established
and
bound
themselves
to
render
mutual
help
for
six
years
After
the
death
of
Matthias
Holy
Roman
Emperor
and
king
of
Bohemia
the
kingdom
deprived
his
successor
Ferdinand
II
in
1618
of
the
Bohemian
crown
and
elected
Frederick
V
Elector
Palatine
as
King
on
August
26
and
27
August
1619
After
the
election
as
Emperor
Ferdinand
conferred
with
the
spiritual
electors
at
Frankfurt
asking
for
the
support
of
the
League
Now
the
formation
of
a
confederate
army
began
With
7
000
men
Bavaria
supplied
the
largest
contribution
to
the
army
whose
strength
was
fixed
at
W
rzburg
in
December
1619
as
21
000
infantry
and
4000
cavalry
Commander
in
chief
was
Johann
Tserclaes
Count
of
Tilly
a
descendant
of
a
Catholic
Brabantine
family
Facing
the
superiority
of
the
League
army
of
30
000
men
confronting
the
Protestant
Union
s
army
of
10
000
on
3
July
1620
the
Union
agreed
to
cease
all
hostilities
between
both
parties
during
the
war
in
Austria
and
Bohemia
The
League
in
War
edit
Battle
of
White
Mountain
Without
the
risk
of
an
attack
the
League
could
use
all
its
military
forces
to
support
the
emperor
The
same
month
the
army
was
relocated
to
Upper
Austria
Tilly
won
the
Battle
of
White
Mountain
north
of
Prague
on
8
November
1620
in
which
half
of
the
enemy
forces
were
killed
or
captured
losing
only
700
men
The
Emperor
regained
control
over
Bohemia
and
the
first
stage
of
the
League
s
activity
during
the
Thirty
Years
War
ended
After
the
end
of
the
Bohemian
War
the
League
s
army
fought
in
central
Germany
but
was
defeated
at
the
Battle
of
Mingolsheim
on
27
April
1622
after
which
they
joined
with
the
Spanish
to
fight
and
win
the
Battle
of
Wimpfen
against
the
Margrave
of
Baden
Durlach
on
May
6
Following
these
victories
the
army
captured
the
city
of
Heidelberg
the
capital
of
the
leader
of
the
Protestant
Union
following
an
eleven
week
siege
on
September
19
The
Protestant
prince
Christian
Duke
of
Brunswick
L
neburg
raised
another
army
but
was
defeated
at
the
Battle
of
Stadtlohn
where
13
000
out
of
his
army
of
15
000
were
lost
This
victory
virtually
ended
all
Protestant
resistance
in
Germany
This
caused
Denmark
s
king
Christian
IV
to
enter
the
Thirty
Years
War
in
1625
to
protect
Protestantism
and
also
in
a
bid
to
make
himself
the
primary
leader
of
Northern
Europe
Johann
Tserclaes
Count
of
Tilly
commander
in
chief
of
the
army
of
the
Catholic
League
The
league
s
army
fought
and
defeated
the
Danish
on
26
27
August
1626
at
the
Battle
of
Lutter
destroying
more
than
half
the
fleeing
Danish
army
Because
this
and
other
victories
by
Wallenstein
Denmark
was
forced
to
sue
for
peace
at
the
Treaty
of
L
beck
Now
the
Catholic
League
hit
its
peak
Almost
the
whole
German
territories
were
under
their
control
The
danger
of
imperial
hegemony
resulting
from
this
success
made
the
Swedish
King
Gustavus
Adolphus
become
involved
in
the
conflict
in
1630
While
Gustavus
Adolphus
landed
his
army
in
Pomerania
and
tried
to
make
alliances
with
the
leaders
of
Northern
Germany
the
League
s
army
laid
siege
to
the
city
of
Magdeburg
for
two
months
from
20
March
1631
as
the
city
had
promised
to
support
Sweden
On
May
20
40
000
successfully
attacked
Magdeburg
A
massacre
of
the
populace
ensued
in
which
25
000
of
the
30
000
inhabitants
of
the
city
perished
while
fires
destroyed
much
of
the
city
It
is
not
clear
whether
the
commander
in
chief
of
the
League
s
forces
Count
Tilly
ordered
the
massacre
Magdeburg
was
a
strategically
vital
city
in
the
Elbe
River
region
and
was
needed
as
a
resupply
center
for
the
looming
fight
against
the
Swedes
Therefore
it
would
have
been
logical
behavior
not
to
destroy
but
to
occupy
the
town
with
troops
of
the
League
In
1630
Ferdinand
II
dismissed
his
Generalissimus
Wallenstein
Now
the
Catholic
League
was
in
control
of
all
the
Catholic
armed
forces
The
end
of
the
Catholic
League
edit
At
the
First
Battle
of
Breitenfeld
the
Catholic
League
led
by
General
Tilly
was
defeated
by
the
Swedish
forces
A
year
later
1632
they
met
again
in
the
Battle
of
Rain
and
this
time
General
Tilly
was
killed
The
upper
hand
had
now
switched
from
the
league
to
the
union
led
by
Sweden
who
were
able
to
attack
and
capture
or
destroy
the
territories
of
the
Catholic
League
Even
Munich
the
capital
of
Bavaria
was
conquered
Thereafter
the
German
Catholic
League
did
not
play
a
major
role
in
later
events
The
Peace
of
Prague
of
30
May
1635
was
a
treaty
between
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
Ferdinand
II
and
most
of
the
Protestant
states
of
the
Empire
It
effectively
ended
the
civil
war
aspect
of
the
Thirty
Years
War
The
Edict
of
Restitution
of
1629
was
effectively
revoked
with
the
terms
of
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
of
1555
being
reestablished
as
at
12
November
1627
One
of
the
most
important
regulations
was
that
formal
alliances
between
states
of
the
Empire
were
prohibited
The
armies
of
the
various
states
were
to
be
unified
with
those
of
the
Emperor
as
an
army
for
the
Empire
as
a
whole
The
result
of
this
clause
was
the
end
of
the
Catholic
League
a
now
prohibited
alliance
between
states
of
the
Empire
As
well
as
ending
the
fighting
between
the
various
states
the
treaty
also
ended
religion
as
a
source
of
national
conflict
the
principle
of
cuius
regio
eius
religio
was
established
for
good
within
the
Empire

his
achievement
in

field

reform
trade

as
great
as
his

His

transformed
a
backward
almost
medieval
economy

society
were
in

not

Life

Gustavus
Adolphus
was
born
in
Stockholm
as
the
oldest
son
of
Duke
Charles
of
the
Vasa
dynasty
and
his
second
wife
Christina
of
Holstein
Gottorp
At
the
time
the
King
of
Sweden
was
Gustavus
Adolphus
cousin
Sigismund
The
staunch
Protestant
Duke
Charles
forced
the
Catholic
Sigismund
to
let
go
of
the
throne
of
Sweden
in
1599
a
part
of
the
preliminary
religious
strife
before
the
Thirty
Years
War
and
reigned
as
regent
before
taking
the
throne
as
Charles
IX
of
Sweden
in
1604
Crown
Prince
Gustav
Adolph
had
Gagnef
Floda
in
Dalecarlia
as
a
duchy
from
1610
Upon
his
father
s
death
in
October
1611
a
sixteen
year
old
Gustavus
inherited
the
throne
declared
of
age
and
able
to
reign
himself
at
seventeen
as
of
16
December
13
as
well
as
an
ongoing
succession
of
occasionally
belligerent
dynastic
disputes
with
his
Polish
cousin
Sigismund
III
wanted
to
regain
the
throne
of
Sweden
and
tried
to
force
Gustavus
Adolphus
to
renounce
the
title
In
a
round
of
this
dynastic
dispute
Gustavus
invaded
Livonia
when
he
was
31
beginning
the
Polish
Swedish
War
1626
29
He
intervened
on
behalf
of
the
Lutherans
in
Germany
who
opened
the
gates
to
their
cities
to
him
His
reign
became
famous
from
his
actions
a
few
years
later
when
in
June
1630
he
landed
in
Germany
marking
the
Swedish
Intervention
in
the
Thirty
Years
War
Gustavus
intervened
on
the
anti
Imperial
side
which
at
the
time
was
losing
to
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
and
its
Catholic
allies
the
Swedish
forces
would
quickly
reverse
that
situation
Gustavus
was
married
to
Maria
Eleonora
of
Brandenburg
a
the
daughter
of
John
Sigismund
Elector
of
Brandenburg
and
chose
the
Prussian
city
of
Elbing
as
the
base
for
his
operations
in
Germany
He
died
in
the
Battle
of
L
tzen
in
1632
His
early
death
was
a
great
loss
to
the
Lutheran
side
This
resulted
in
large
parts
of
Germany
and
other
countries
which
had
been
conquered
for
Lutheranism
to
be
reconquered
for
Catholicism
via
the
Counter
Reformation
His
involvement
in
the
Thirty
Years
War
gave
rise
to
the
saying
that
he
was
the
incarnation
of
the
Lion
of
the
North
or
as
it
is
called
in
German
Der
L
we
aus
Mitternacht

The
Lion

Military
of
the

Historian
Ronald
S
Love
finds
that
in
1560
1660
there
were
a
few
innovators
notably
Maurice
of
Nassau
and
Gustavus
Adolphus
of
Sweden
whom
many
scholars
credit
with
revolutionary
developments
in
warfare
and
with
having
laid
the
foundations
of
military
practice
for
the
next
two
centuries
14
Scholars
all
agree
that
Gustavus
Adolphus
was
an
extremely
able
military
commander
15
His
innovative
tactical
integration
of
infantry
cavalry
logistics
and
particularly
his
use
of
artillery
earned
him
the
title
of
the
Father
of
Modern
Warfare
Future
commanders
who
studied
and
admired
Gustav
II
Adolf
include
Napoleon
I
of
France
and
Carl
von
Clausewitz
His
advancements
in
military
science
made
Sweden
the
dominant
Baltic
power
for
the
next
one
hundred
years
see
Swedish
Empire
He
is
also
the
only
Swedish
monarch
to
be
styled
the
Great
This
decision
was
made
by
the
Swedish
Estates
of
the
Realm
when
they
convened
in
1633
Thus
by
their
decision
he
is
officially
to
this
day
to
be
called
Gustaf
Adolf
the
Great
Gustavus
Adolphus
Magnus
The

Gustavus
Adolphus
depicted
at
the
turning
point
of
the
Battle
of
Breitenfeld
1631
against
the
forces
of
Count
Tilly
Gustavus
Adolphus
was
the
main
figure
responsible
for
the
success
of
Swedish
arms
during
the
Thirty
Years
War
and
led
his
nation
to
great
prestige
As
a
general
Gustavus
Adolphus
is
famous
for
employing
mobile
artillery
on
the
battlefield
as
well
as
very
aggressive
tactics
where
attack
was
stressed
over
defense
and
mobility
and
cavalry
initiative
were
emphasized
Among
other
innovations
he
installed
an
early
form
of
combined
arms
in
his
formations
where
the
cavalry
could
attack
from
the
safety
of
an
infantry
line
reinforced
by
cannon
and
retire
again
within
to
regroup
after
their
foray
Inspired
by
the
reform
of
Maurice
of
Nassau
he
adopted
much
shallower
infantry
formations
than
were
common
in
the
pike
and
shot
armies
of
the
era
with
formations
typically
fighting
in
5
or
6
ranks
occasionally
supported
at
some
distance
by
another
such
formation
the
gaps
being
the
provinces
of
the
artillery
and
cavalry
as
noted
above
His
artillery
were
themselves
different
in
addition
to
the
usual
complements
of
heavy
cannon
he
introduced
light
mobile
guns
for
the
first
time
into
the
Renaissance
battlefield
These
were
grouped
in
batteries
supporting
his
more
linearly
deployed
formations
replacing
the
cumbersome
and
unmaneuverable
traditional
deep
squares
such
as
the
Spanish
Tercios
that
were
up
to
50
ranks
deep
used
in
other
pike
and
shot
armies
of
the
day
In
consequence
his
forces
could
redeploy
and
reconfigure
very
rapidly
confounding
his
enemies
16
17
He
created
the
modern
Swedish
navy
which
successfully
transported
troops
and
supplies
to
the
Continental
battlefront
18
von
Clausewitz
and
Napoleon
Bonaparte
considered
him
one
of
the
greatest
generals
of
all
time
an
evaluation
agreed
with
by
George
S
Patton
and
others
He
was
also
renowned
for
his
constancy
of
purpose
and
the
equality
of
his
troops
no
one
part
of
his
armies
was
considered
better
or
received
preferred
treatment
as
was
common
in
other
armies
where
the
cavalry
were
the
elite
followed
by
the
artillery
and
both
disdained
the
lowly
infantry
In
Gustavus
army
the
units
were
extensively
cross
trained
Both
cavalry
and
infantry
could
service
the
artillery
as
his
heavy
cavalry
did
when
turning
captured
artillery
on
the
opposing
Catholic
Tercios
at
First
Breitenfeld
Pikemen
could
shoot
if
not
as
accurately
as
those
designated
musketeers
so
a
valuable
firearm
could
be
kept
in
the
firing
line
His
infantrymen
and
gunners
were
taught
to
ride
if
needed
Napoleon
thought
highly
of
the
achievement
and
copied
the
tactics
However
recent
historians
have
challenged
velocity
reputation
B
H
Liddell
Hart
says
it
is
an
exaggeration
to
credit
him
with
a
uniquely
disciplined
conscript
army
or
call
his
the
first
military
state
to
fight
a
protracted
war
on
the
continent
He
argues
that
he
improved
existing
techniques
and
used
them
brilliantly
Richard
Brzezinski
says
his
legendary
status
was
based
on
inaccurate
myths
created
by
later
historians
Many
of
his
innovations
were
developed
by
his
senior
staff
19
Engraving
of
Gustavus
Adolphus
While
Gustavus
has
been
widely
credited
for
re
emphasizing
the
shock
role
of
European
cavalry
his
innovations
were
hardly
new
Huguenot
cavalry
under
Henry
IV
and
Gaspard
II
de
Coligny
having
fought
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
during
the
French
Wars
of
Religion
As
a
matter
of
fact
his
opponent
Johann
Tserclaes
Count
of
Tilly
also
favored
the
same
ferocious
charges
the
Swedish
cavalry
would
become
famous
for
Neither
was
the
Swedish
practice
of
integrating
shot
and
horse
the
so
called
commanded
shot
a
new
one
with
the
Huguenot
horsemen
at
the
battle
of
Coutras
having
the
same
supporting
shooters
What
made
the
Swedish
army
unique
in
this
regard
was
the
fact
that
the
use
of
commanded
shot
became
the
standard
tactical
doctrine
of
its
horse
and
this
in
turn
was
adopted
by
other
armies
of
the
period
including
its
Imperial
opponents
and
that
of
the
English
Civil
War
20
Adolphus
better
deserved
the
credit
of
introducing
a
standard
caliber
light
muskets
to
his
infantry
forces
replacing
the
previous
mix
of
arquebus
and
heavy
musket
common
in
Imperial
tercios
The
shallower
infantry
formation
of
the
Swedish
brigade
much
more
conducive
to
massed
firepower
was
inspired
by
the
work
of
Maurice
However
Adolphus
perfected
the
system
and
introduced
the
use
of
salvo
fire
where
two
or
three
ranks
of
musketeers
fired
simultaneously
usually
at
point
blank
range
rather
than
one
rank
at
a
time
counter
marching
as
was
common
in
that
era
Delivered
at
point
blank
range
and
immediately
followed
up
by
a
charge
with
swords
and
pikes
a
salvo
became
the
infantry
s
most
feared
tactic
because
it
was
much
more
effective
at
breaking
the
enemy
s
morale
and
repulsing
cavalry
charges
than
the
earlier
method
21
Perhaps
Adolphus
greatest
contribution
however
was
his
work
in
field
artillery
Equipping
each
of
his
brigades
with
up
to
12
light
regimental
guns
he
greatly
increased
the
organic
firepower
of
his
infantry
and
for
the
first
time
allowed
the
artillery
arm
to
play
a
role
in
the
offensive
instead
of
being
a
static
spectator
in
a
battle
of
maneuvers

On

he
spoke
before

his
words

these
I
had
carefully
learned
to
understand
about
that
experience
which
I
could
have
upon
things
of
rule
how

that
inasmuch

Gustavus
Adolphus
in
der
Schlacht
von
L
tzen
by
Jan
Asselijn
Gustavus
Adolphus
inherited
three
wars
from
his
father
when
he
ascended
the
throne
against
Denmark
which
had
attacked
Sweden
earlier
in
1611
against
Russia
due
to
Sweden
having
tried
to
take
advantage
of
the
Russian
Time
of
Troubles
and
against
Poland
due
to
King
Charles
s
having
deposed
King
Sigismund
III
his
nephew
as
King
of
Sweden
The
war
against
Denmark
Kalmar
War
was
concluded
in
1613
with
a
peace
that
did
not
cost
Sweden
any
territory
but
it
was
forced
to
pay
a
heavy
indemnity
to
Denmark
Treaty
of
Kn
red
During
this
war
Gustavus
Adolphus
let
his
soldiers
plunder
towns
and
villages
and
as
he
met
little
resistance
from
Danish
forces
in
Scania
they
pillaged
and
devastated
twenty
four
Scanian
parishes
His
memory
in
Scania
has
been
negative
because
of
that
fear
27
In
the
winter
of
1612
during
a
period
of
two
weeks
did
he
burn
down
or
otherwise
destroyed
24
Scanian
parishes
and
most
of
their
population
without
meeting
any
enemy
troops
The
largest
destroyed
settlement
was
the
Town
V
which
two
years
later
was
replaced
by
Danish
King
Christian
IV
as
the
nearby
Christiansted
after
the
Swedification
process
spelled
Kristianstad
the
last
Scanian
town
to
be
founded
by
a
Danish
king
28

The
war
against
Russia
Ingrian
War
ended
in
1617
with
the
Treaty
of
Stolbovo
which
excluded
Russia
from
the
Baltic
Sea
The
final
inherited
war
the
war
against
Poland
ended
in
1629
with
the
Truce
of
Altmark
which
transferred
the
large
province
Livonia
to
Sweden
and
freed
the
Swedish
forces
for
the
subsequent
intervention
in
the
Thirty
Years
War
in
Germany
where
Swedish
forces
had
already
established
a
bridgehead
in
1628
The
weak
electorate
of
Brandenburg
was
especially
torn
apart
by
a
quarrel
between
the
Protestant
and
Catholic
parties
The
Brandenburg
minister
and
diplomat
Baron
Samuel
von
Winterfeld
influenced
Gustavus
Adolphus
to
support
and
protect
the
Protestant
side
in
Germany
When
Gustavus
Adolphus
began
his
push
into
northern
Germany
in
June
July
1630
he
had
just
4
000
troops
He
was
soon
able
to
consolidate
the
Protestant
position
in
the
north
however
using
reinforcements
from
Sweden
and
money
supplied
by
France
at
the
Treaty
of
B
rwalde
After
Swedish
plundering
in
Brandenburg
1631
endangered
the
system
of
retrieving
war
contributions
from
occupied
territories
marauding
and
plundering
by
Swedish
soldiers
was
prohibited
30
Meanwhile
a
Catholic
army
under
Johann
Tserclaes
Count
of
Tilly
was
laying
waste
to
Saxony
Gustavus
Adolphus
met
Tilly
s
army
and
crushed
it
at
the
First
Battle
of
Breitenfeld
in
September
1631
He
then
marched
clear
across
Germany
establishing
his
winter
quarters
near
the
Rhine
making
plans
for
the
invasion
of
the
rest
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
In
March
1632
Gustavus
Adolphus
invaded
Bavaria
a
staunch
ally
of
the
Emperor
He
forced
the
withdrawal
of
his
Catholic
opponents
at
the
Battle
of
Rain
marking
the
high
point
of
the
campaign
In
the
summer
of
that
year
he
sought
a
political
solution
that
would
preserve
the
existing
structure
of
states
in
Germany
while
guaranteeing
the
security
of
its
Protestants
But
achieving
these
objectives
depended
on
his
continued
success
on
the
battlefield
Gustavus
is
reported
to
have
entered
battle
without

The
Battle

November

1632
was
one
of
the
most
decisive
battles
of
the
Thirty
Years
War
It
was
a
Protestant
victory
but
the
Protestant
alliance
lost
one
of
its
most
important
leaders
which
caused
the
Protestant
campaign
to
lose
direction
Gustavus
Adolphus
was
killed
when
at
a
crucial
point
in
the
battle
he
became
separated
from
his
troops
while
leading
a
cavalry
charge

Towards
1
00
pm
in
the
thick
mix
of
gun
smoke
and
fog
covering
the
field
the
king
was
separated
from
his
fellow
riders
and
suffered
multiple
shots
A
bullet
crushed
his
left
arm
below
the
elbow
Almost
simultaneously
his
horse
suffered
a
shot
to
the
neck
that
made
it
hard
to
control
In
the
mix
of
fog
and
smoke
from
the
burning
town
of
L
tzen
the
king
rode
astray
behind
enemy
lines
There
he
sustained
yet
another
shot
in
the
back
was
stabbed
and
fell
from
his
horse
Lying
on
the
ground
he
received
a
final
fatal
shot
to
the
temple
His
fate
remained
unknown
for
some
time
However
when
the
gunnery
paused
and
the
smoke
cleared
his
horse
was
spotted
between
the
two
lines
Gustavus
himself
not
on
it
and
nowhere
to
be
seen
His
disappearance
stopped
the
initiative
of
the
hitherto
successful
Swedish
right
wing
while
a
search
was
conducted
His
partly
stripped
body
was
found
an
hour
or
two
later
and
was
secretly
evacuated
from
the
field
in
a
Swedish
artillery
wagon
After
his
death
Gustavus
s
wife
initially
kept
his
body
and
later
his
heart
in
the
castle
of
Nyk
ping
for
over

Aftermath
edit
In
February
1633
following
the
death
of
the
king
the
Swedish
Riksdag
of
the
Estates
decided
that
his
name
would
be
styled
Gustav
Adolf
the
Great
or
Gustaf
Adolf
den
Store
in
Swedish
Latinized
as
Gustavus
Adolphus
Magnus
No
such
honor
has
been
bestowed
on
any
other
Swedish
monarch
before
or
since
The
crown
of
Sweden
was
inherited
in
the
Vasa
family
and
from
Charles
IX
s
time
excluded
those
Vasa
princes
who
had
been
traitors
or
descended
from
deposed
monarchs
Gustavus
Adolphus
younger
brother
had
died
ten
years
before
and
therefore
there
was
only
the
King
s
daughter
left
as
a
female
heir
Maria
Eleonora
and
the
king
s
ministers
took
over
the
government
on

of

Adolphus
underage

Gustav
Adolph

Stockholm
Palace
The
Columbia
Encyclopedia
sums
up
his
record
In
military
organization
and
strategy
Gustavus
was
ahead
of
his
time
While
most
powers
relied
on
mercenary
troops
he
organized
a
national
standing
army
that
distinguished
itself
by
its
discipline
and
relatively
high
moral
standards
Deeply
religious
the
king
desired
his
soldiers
to
behave
like
a
truly
Christian
army
his
stern
measures
against
the
common
practices
of
looting
raping
and
torture
were
effective
until
his
death
His
successes
were
due
to
this
discipline
his
use
of
small
mobile
units
the
superiority
of
his
firearms
and
his
personal
charisma
Although
he
was
deeply
interested
in
the
internal
progress
of
his
kingdom
much
of
the
credit
for
the
development
of
Swedish
industry
and
the
fiscal
and
administrative
reforms
of
his
reign
belongs
to
Oxenstierna

The
German
Socialist
Franz
Mehring
wrote
a
biography
of
Gustavus
Adolphus
with
a
Marxist
perspective
on
the
actions
of
the
Swedish
king
during
the
Thirty
Years
War
In
it
he
makes
a
case
that
the
war
was
fought
over
economics
and
trade
rather
than
religion
The
Swedes
discovered
huge
deposits
of
copper
which
were
used
to
build
brass
cannon
The
cottage
industrial
growth
stimulated
an
armaments
industry

Gustav

In
his
book
Ofreds
r
Years
of
Warfare
the
Swedish
historian
and
author
Peter
Englund
argues
that
there
was
probably
no
single
all
important
reason
for
the
king
s
decision
to
go
to
war
Instead
it
was
likely
a
combination
of
religious
security
as
well
as
economic
considerations
This
view
is
supported
by
German
historian
Johannes
Burkhardt
who
writes
that
Gustavus
entered
the
30
Years
War
exactly
100
years
after
the
publication
of
the
Confessio
Augustana
the
core
confession
of
faith
of
the
Lutheran
Church
and
let
himself
be
praised
as
its
saviour
Yet
Gustavus
own
manifesto
of
war
does
not
mention
any
religious
motivations
at
all
but
speaks
of
political
and
economical
reasons
Sweden
would
have
to
maintain
its
integrity
in
the
face
of
several
provocations
and
aggressions
by
the
Habsburgian
Empire
The
manifesto
was
written
by
scholar
Johann
Adler
Salvius
in
a
style
common
of
the
time
that
promotes
a
just
war
Burkhardt
argues
that
traditional
Swedish
historiography
constructed
a
defensive
interest
in
security
out
of
that
by
taking
the
manifesto
s
text
for
granted
But
to
defend
Stockholm
the
occupation
of
the
German
Baltic
territories
would
have
been
an
extreme
advance
and
the
imperial
Baltic
Sea
fleet
mentioned
as
a
threat
in
the
manifesto
had
never
reached
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
size
of
the
Swedish
fleet
Moreover
it
was
never
maintained
to
challenge
Sweden
but
to
face
the
separatist
Netherlands
So
if
ruling
the
Baltic
Sea
was
a
goal
of
Swedish
strategy
the
conquests
in
Germany
were
not
a
defensive
war
but
an
act
of
expansion
From
Swedish
Finland
Gustavus
advanced
along
the
Baltic
Sea
coast
and
eventually
to
Augsburg
and
Munich
and
he
even
urged
the
Swiss
Confederacy
to
join
him
This
was
no
longer
about
Baltic
interests
but
the
imperial
capital
of
Vienna
and
the
alpine
passes
that
were
now
in
close
reach
of
the
Swedish
army
Burkhardt
points
out
that
the
Gothic
legacy
of
the
Swedes
coalesced
as
a
political
program
The
Swedish
king
was
also
Rex
Gotorum
Latin
King
of
the
Goths
and
the
list
of
kings
was
traced
back
to
the
Gothic
rulers
to
construct
continuity
Prior
to
his
embarkment
to
northern
Germany
Gustavus
urged
the
Swedish
nobility
to
follow
the
example
of
conquests
set
by
their
Gothic
ancestors
Had
he
lived
longer
it
would
have
been
likely
that
Gustavus
had
reached
out
for
the
imperial
crown
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire

The
Siege
of
Nuremberg
or
Siege
of
N
rnberg
was
a
battle
campaign
that
took
place
in
1632
about
the
Imperial
City
of
Nuremberg
during
the
Thirty
Years
War
In
1632
rather
than
face
the
numerically
superior
Imperial
army
under
the
command
of
Albrecht
von
Wallenstein
Gustavus
Adolphus
of
Sweden
ordered
a
tactical
retreat
into
the
city
of
Nuremberg
Wallenstein
s
army
immediately
started
to
invest
Nuremberg
and
laid
siege
to
the
city
waiting
for
hunger
and
epidemics
to
cripple
the
Swedish
force
It
proved
difficult
for
the
besiegers
to
maintain
the
siege
because
the
city
was
large
and
needed
a
large
force
to
man
the
circumvallation
In
Wallenstein
s
camp
there
were
120
000
soldiers
50
000
horses
15
000
women
and
15
000
servants
Foraging
to
supply
such
a
large
static
besieging
force
proved
to
be
extremely
difficult
Four
Saxon
regiments
and
troops
from
the
Rhine
numbering
around
50
000
troops
with
6
000
cannon
reinforced
the
70
000
regular
troops
and
30
000
Nuremberg
militia
already
deployed
by
Gustavus
Adolphus
With
poor
sanitation
and
inadequate
supplies
both
sides
suffered
from
hunger
typhus
and
scurvy
To
try
to
break
the
deadlock
the
forces
under
the
command
of
Gustavus
Adolphus
attacked
the
entrenchments
of
the
imperial
army
s
circumvallation
in
the
Battle
of
the
Alte
Veste
but
failed
to
break
through
Eventually
the
siege
ended
after
eleven
weeks
when
the
Swedes
and
their
allies
withdrew
Through
a
combination
of
disease
hunger
and
battle
fatalities
about
10
000
inhabitants
of
Nuremberg
and
20
000
Swedish
and
allied
forces
died
The
Imperial
army
suffered
about
20
000
dead
Austria
was
saved
for
the
short
term
but
the
engagement
was
not
decisive

They

bilingually
the

preferred

yet
Wallenstein
in
his
childhood
had
a
better
command
of
Czech
than
of
German
8
His
parents
religious
affiliations
were
Lutheranism
and
Utraquism

After
their
deaths
Albrecht
for
two
years
lived

sent
him
to

school
at

Castle
in
Eastern
Bohemia
citation

In
1597
Albrecht
was
sent
to
the
Protestant
Latin
school
at
Goldberg
now
Z
otoryja
in
Silesia
where
the
then
German
environment
led
him
to
hone
his
German
language
skills
8
While
German
became
Wallenstein
s
lingua
franca
he
is
said
to
have
continued
to
curse
in
Czech
9
On
29
August
1599
Wallenstein
continued
his
education
at
the
Protestant
University
of
Altdorf
near
Nuremberg
Franconia
where
he
was
often
engaged
in
brawls
and
p
e
fights
leading
to
his
imprisonment
in
the
town
prison
8
In
February
1600
8
Albrecht
left
Altdorf
and
travelled
around
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
France
and
Italy
10
where
he
studied
at
the
universities
of
Bologna
and
Padua
11
By
this
time
Wallenstein
was
fluent
in
German
Czech
Latin
and
Italian
was
able
to
understand
Spanish
and
spoke
some
French
8
Wallenstein
then
joined
the
army
of
the
Emperor
Rudolf
II
in
Hungary
where
under
the
command
of
Giorgio
Basta
he
saw
two
years
of
armed
service
1604
1606
against
the
Ottoman
Turks
and
Hungarian
rebels
11
In
1604
his
sister
Kate
ina
Anna
married
the
leader
of
the
Moravian
Protestants
Karel
the
Older
of
Zierotin
12
He
then
studied
at
the
University
of
Olomouc
matriculating
in
1606
His
contact
with
the
Olomouc
Jesuits
was
partly
responsible
for
his
conversion
to
Catholicism
in
the
same
year
10
The
contributory
factor
to
his
conversion
may
have
been
the
Counter
Reformation
policy
of
the
Habsburgs
that
effectively
barred
Protestants
from
being
appointed
to
higher
offices
at
court
in
Bohemia
and
in
Moravia
and
the
impressions
he
gathered
in
Catholic
Italy
13
However
there
are
no
sources
clearly
indicating
the
reasons
for
Wallenstein
s
conversion
except
for
a
subjunctive
anecdote
by
his
contemporary
Franz
Christoph
von
Khevenh

about
the
Virgin
Mary
saving
Wallenstein
s
life
when
he
fell
from
a
window
in

The
Thirty
Years
War
began
in
1618
when
the
estates
of
Bohemia
rebelled
against
Ferdinand
of
Styria
and
elected
Frederick
V
Elector
Palatine
the
leader
of
the
Protestant
Union
as
their
new
king
Wallenstein
associated
himself
with
the
cause
of
the
Catholics
and
the
Habsburg
dynasty
Sympathizing
with
the
Bohemians
he
used
his
position
as
commander
of
the
troops
of
the
Moravian
estates
to
escape
with
the
Moravian
treasure
chest
to
Vienna
There
however
the
authorities
told
him
that
the
money
would
go
back
to
the
Moravians
but
he
had
shown
his
loyalty
to
Ferdinand
the
future
Emperor
Wallenstein
equipped
a
regiment
of
cuirassiers
and
won
great
distinction
under
Charles
Bonaventure
de
Longueval
Count
of
Bucquoy
in
the
wars
against
Ernst
von
Mansfeld
and
Gabriel
Bethlen
both
supporters
of
the
Bohemian
revolt
in
Moravia
Wallenstein
recovered
his
lands
which
the
rebels
had
seized
in
1619
and
after
the
Battle
of
White
Mountain
8
November
1620
he
secured
the
estates
belonging
to
his
mother
s
family
and
confiscated
tracts
of
Protestant
lands
He
grouped
his
new
possessions
into
a
territory
called
Friedland
Fr
dlant
in
northern
Bohemia
A
series
of
successes
in
battle
led
to
Wallenstein
becoming
in
1622
an
imperial
count
palatine
in
1623
a
prince
and
in
1625
Duke
of
Friedland
18
Wallenstein
proved
an
able
administrator
of
the

Having
beaten
Mansfeld
at
Dessau
25
April
1626
Wallenstein
cleared
Silesia
of
the
remnants
of
Mansfeld
s
army
in
1627
21
22
At
this
time
he
bought
from
the
emperor
the
Duchy
of
Sagan
in
Silesia
He
then
joined
Tilly
in
the
struggle
against
Christian
IV
of
Denmark
23
and
afterwards
gained
as
a
reward
the
Duchies
of
Mecklenburg
whose
hereditary
dukes
suffered
expulsion
for
having
helped
the
Danish
king
This
awarding
of
a
major
territory
to
someone
of
the
lower
nobility
shocked
the
high
born
rulers
of
many
other
German
states
24
Wallenstein
assumed
the
title
of
Admiral
of
the
North
and
Baltic
Seas
However
in
1628
he
failed
to
capture
Stralsund
which
resisted
the
Capitulation
of
Franzburg
and
the
subsequent
siege
with
assistance
of
Danish
Scottish
and
Swedish
troops
a
blow
that
denied
him
access
to
the
Baltic
and
the
chance
of
challenging
the
naval
power
of
the
Scandinavian
kingdoms
and
of
the
Netherlands
22
Although
he
succeeded
in
defeating
Christian
IV
of
Denmark
in
the
Battle
of
Wolgast
and
neutralizing
Denmark
in
the
subsequent
Peace
of
L
beck
25
the
situation
further
deteriorated
when
the
presence
of
Imperial
Catholic
troops
on
the
Baltic
and
the
Emperor
s
Edict
of
Restitution
brought
King
Gustavus
Adolphus
of
Sweden
into
the
conflict
22
Wallenstein
attempted
to
aid
the
forces
of
the
Polish
Lithuanian
Commonwealth
under
Hetman
Stanis
aw
Koniecpolski
which
were
fighting
Sweden
in
1629
However
Wallenstein
failed
to
engage
any
major
Swedish
forces
and
this
significantly
affected
the
outcome
of
the
conflict

Engraving
of
Albrecht
von
Wallenstein
Over
the
course
of
the
war
Wallenstein
s
ambitions
and
the
abuses
of
his
forces
had
earned
him
a
host
of
enemies
both
Catholic
and
Protestant
princes
and
non
princes
alike
Ferdinand
suspected
Wallenstein
of
planning
a
coup
to
take
control
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
The
Emperor
s
advisors
advocated
dismissing
him
and
in
September
1630
envoys
were
sent
to
Wallenstein
to
announce
his
removal
18
Wallenstein
gave
over
his
army
to
General
Tilly
and
retired
to
Ji
n
the
capital
of
his
Duchy
of
Friedland
There
he
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
mysterious
magnificence
27
However
circumstances
forced
Ferdinand
to
call
Wallenstein
into
the
field
again
18
The
successes
of
Gustavus
Adolphus
over
General
Tilly
at
the
Battle
of
Breitenfeld
and
on
the
Lech
1632
where
Tilly
was
killed
and
his
advance
to
Munich
and
occupation
of
Bohemia
demanded
action
27
In
mid
1632
Wallenstein
raised
a
fresh
army
within
a
few
weeks
and
took
to
the
field
He
drove
the
Saxon
army
from
Bohemia
and
then
advanced
against
Gustavus
Adolphus
whom
he
opposed
near
Nuremberg
and
after
the
Battle
of
the
Alte
Veste
dislodged
In
November
came
the
great
Battle
of
L
tzen
in
which
Wallenstein
was
forced
to
retreat
but
in
the
confused
melee
Gustavus
Adolphus
was
killed
Wallenstein
withdrew
to
winter
quarters
in
Bohemia
27
In
the
campaigning
of
1633
Wallenstein
s
apparent
unwillingness
to
attack
the
enemy
caused
much
concern
in
Vienna
and
in
Spain
At
this
time
the
dimensions
of
the
war
grew
more
European
Wallenstein
had
begun
preparing
to
desert
the
Emperor
He
expressed
anger
at
Ferdinand
s
refusal
to
revoke
the
Edict
of
Restitution
Historic
records
tell
little
about
his
secret
negotiations
but
some
sources
clarification
needed
indicated
he
was
preparing
to
force
a
just
peace
on
the
Emperor
in
the
interests
of
united
Germany
With
this
apparent
plan
he
entered
into
negotiations
with
Saxony
Brandenburg
Sweden
and
France
But
apparently
the
Habsburgs
enemies
tried
to
draw
him
to
their
side
In
any
case
he
gained
little
support
Anxious
to
make
his
power
felt
he
resumed
the
offensive
against
the
Swedes
and
Saxons
winning
his
last
victory
at
Steinau
on
the
Oder
in
October
He
then
resumed
negotiations
28
Assassination
edit
The
Killing
of
Wallenstein
in
Eger
Cheb
In
December
Wallenstein
retired
with
his
army
to
Bohemia
around
Pilsen
now
Plze
Vienna
soon
definitely
convinced
itself
of
his
treachery
a
secret
court
found
him
guilty
and
the
Emperor
looked
seriously
for
a
means
of
getting
rid
of
him
a
successor
in
command
the
later
emperor
Ferdinand
III
was
already
waiting
Wallenstein
was
aware
of
the
plan
to
replace
him
but
felt
confident
that
when
the
army
came
to
decide
between
him
and
the
Emperor
the
decision
would
be
in
his
favour
27
On
24
January
1634
the
Emperor
signed
a
secret
patent
shown
only
to
certain
officers
of
Wallenstein
s
army
removing
him
from
his
command
Finally
an
open
patent
charging
Wallenstein
with
high
treason
was
signed
on
18
February
and
published
in
Prague
18
In
the
patent
Ferdinand
II
ordered
to
have
Wallenstein
brought
under
arrest
to
Vienna
dead
or
alive
29
Losing
the
support
of
his
army
Wallenstein
now
realized
the
extent
of
his
peril
and
on
23
February
with
a
company
of
some
hundred
men
he
went
from
Plze
to
Eger
Cheb
hoping
to
meet
the
Swedes
under
Duke
Bernhard
30
After
his
arrival
at
Cheb
however
certain
senior
Scottish
and
Irish
officers
in
his
force
assassinated
him
on
the
night
of
February
25
27
To
carry
out
the
assassination
a
regiment
of
dragoons
under
the
command
of
an
Irish
colonel
Walter
Butler
31
and
the
Scots
colonels
Walter
Leslie
and
John
Gordon
32
first
fell
upon
Wallenstein
s
trusted
officers
Adam
Trczka
Vil

Kinsky
Christian
Illov
and
Henry
Neumann
while
the
latter
attended
a
feast
at
Cheb
Castle
which
had
come
under
the
command
of
Gordon
himself
and
massacred
them
Trczka
alone
managed
to
fight
his
way
out
into
the
courtyard
only
to
be
shot
down
by
a
group
of
musketeers
24
A
few
hours
later
an
Irish
captain
Walter
Devereux
together
with
a
few
companions
broke
into
the
burgomaster
s
house
at
the
main
square
where
Wallenstein
had
his
lodgings
again
courtesy
of
Gordon
and
kicked
open

bedroom

Devereux

ran

Wallenstein
s
particular
genius
lay
in
recognizing
a
new
way
for
funding
war
instead
of
merely
plundering
enemies
he
called
for
a
new
method
of
systematic
war
taxes
Even
a
city
or
a
prince
on
the
side
of
the
Emperor
had
to
pay
taxes
towards
the
war
citation

Wallenstein
understood
the
enormous
wastage
of
resources
that
resulted
from
tax
exactions
on
princes
and
cities
of
defeated
enemies
only
and
desired
to
replace
this
with
a
balanced
system
of
taxation
wherein
both
sides
bore
the
cost
of
a
war
He
was
unable
to
fully
realize
this
ambition
His
idea
led
to
the
random
exploitation
of
whole
populations
on
either
side
until
finally
almost
fifteen
years
after
his
death
the
war
had
become
so
expensive
that
the
warring
parties
were
forced
to
make
peace

by

Baroque
architecture
is
the
building
style
of
the
Baroque
era
begun
in
late
16th
century
Italy
that
took
the
Roman
vocabulary
of
Renaissance
architecture
and
used
it
in
a
new
rhetorical
and
theatrical
fashion
often
to
express
the
triumph
of
the
Catholic
Church
It
was
characterized
by
new
explorations
of
form
light
and
shadow
and
dramatic
intensity
Whereas
the
Renaissance
drew
on
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
Italian
courts
and
was
a
blend
of
secular
and
religious
forces
the
Baroque
was
initially
at
least
directly
linked
to
the
Counter
Reformation
a
movement
within
the
Catholic
Church
to
reform
itself
in
response
to
the
Protestant
Reformation
1
Baroque
architecture
and
its
embellishments
were
on
the
one
hand
more
accessible
to
the
emotions
and
on
the
other
hand
a
visible
statement
of
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
Catholic
Church
The
new
style
manifested
itself
in
particular
in
the
context
of
the
new
religious
orders
like
the
Theatines
and
the
Jesuits
who
aimed
to
improve
popular
piety
The
architecture
of
the
High
Roman
Baroque
can
be
assigned
to
the
papal
reigns
of
Urban
VIII
Innocent
X
and
Alexander
VII
spanning
from
1623
to
1667
The
three
principal
architects
of
this
period
were
the
sculptor
Gianlorenzo
Bernini
Francesco
Borromini
and
the
painter
Pietro
da
Cortona
and
each
evolved
his
own
distinctively
individual
architectural
expression
Dissemination
of
Baroque
architecture
to
the
south
of
Italy
resulted
in
regional
variations
such
as
Sicilian
Baroque
architecture
or
that
of
Naples
and
Lecce
To
the
north
the
Theatine
architect
Camillo
Guarino
Guarini
Bernardo
Vittone
and
Sicilian
born
Filippo
Juvarra
contributed
Baroque
buildings
to
the
city
of
Turin
and
the
Piedmont
region
A
synthesis
of
Bernini
Borromini
and
Cortona
s
architecture
can
be
seen
in
the
late
Baroque
architecture
of
northern
Europe
which
paved
the
way
for
the
more
decorative
Rococo
style
By
the
middle
of
the
17th
century
the
Baroque
style
had
found
its
secular
expression
in
the
form
of
grand
palaces
first
in
France
with
the
Ch
teau
de
Maisons
1642
near
Paris
by
Fran
ois
Mansart
and
then
throughout
Europe
During
the
17th
century
Baroque
architecture
spread
through
Europe
and
Latin
America
where
it
was
particularly
promoted
by
the
Jesuits

During

Church
Though
the
tendency
has
been
to
see
Baroque
architecture
as
a
European
phenomenon
it
coincided
with
and
is
integrally
enmeshed
with
the
rise
of
European
colonialism
Colonialism
required
the
development
of
centralized
and
powerful
governments
with
Spain
and
France
the
first
to
move
in
this
direction
3
Colonialism
brought
in
huge
amounts
of
wealth
not
only
in
the
silver
that
was
extracted
from
the
mines
in
Bolivia
Mexico
and
elsewhere
but
also
in
the
resultant
trade
in
commodities
such
as
sugar
and
tobacco
The
need
to
control
trade
routes
monopolies
and
slavery
which
lay
primarily
in
the
hands
of
the
French
during
the
17th
century
created
an
almost
endless
cycle
of
wars
between
the
colonial
powers
the
French
religious
wars
the
Thirty
Years
War
1618
and
1648
Franco
Spanish
War
1653
the
Franco
Dutch
War
1672
1678
and
so
on
The
initial
mismanagement
of
colonial
wealth
by
the
Spaniards
bankrupted
them
in
the
16th
century
1557
and
1560
recovering
only
slowly
in
the
following
century
This
explains
why
the
Baroque
style
though
enthusiastically
developed
throughout
the
Spanish
Empire
was
to
a
large
extent
in
Spain
an
architecture
of
surfaces
and
fa
ades
unlike
in
France
and
Austria
where
we
see
the
construction
of
numerous
huge
palaces
and
monasteries
In
contrast
to
Spain
the
French
under
Jean
Baptiste
Colbert
1619
1683
the
minister
of
finance
had
begun
to
industrialize
their
economy
and
thus
were
able
to
become
initially
at
least
the
benefactors
of
the
flow
of
wealth
While
this
was
good
for
the
building
industries
and
the
arts
the
new
wealth
created
an
inflation
the
likes
of
which
had
never
been
experienced
before
Rome
was
known
just
as
much
for
its
new
sumptuous
churches
as
for
its
vagabonds

Sicilian
Baroque
A
number
of
ecclesiastical
buildings
of
the
Baroque
period
in
Rome
had
plans
based
on
the
Italian
paradigm
of
the
basilica
with
a
crossed
dome
and
nave
but
the
treatment
of
the
architecture
was
very
different
from
what
had
been
carried
out
previously
One
of
the
first
Roman
structures
to
break
with
the
Mannerist
conventions
exemplified
in
the
Ges
was
the
church
of
Santa
Susanna
designed
by
Carlo
Maderno
The
dynamic
rhythm
of
columns
and
pilasters
central
massing
and
the
protrusion
and
condensed
central
decoration
add
complexity
to
the
structure
There
is
an
incipient
playfulness
with
the
rules
of
classic
design
but
it
still
maintains
rigor
The
same
concerns
with
plasticity
massing
dramatic
effects
and
shadow
and
light
is
evident
in
the
architectural
work
of
Pietro
da
Cortona
illustrated
by
his
design
of
Santi
Luca
e
Martina
construction
began
in
1635
with
what
was
probably
the
first
curved
Baroque
church
fa
ade
in
Rome
5
These
concerns
are
even
more
evident
in
his
reworking
of
Santa
Maria
della
Pace
1656
68
The
fa
ade
with
its
chiaroscuro
half
domed
portico
and
concave
side
wings
closely
resembles
a
theatrical
stage
set
and
the
church
fa
ade
projects
forward
so
that
it
substantially
fills
the
tiny
trapezoidal
piazza
Other
Roman
ensembles
of
the
Baroque
and
Late
Baroque
period
are
likewise
suffused
with
theatricality
and
as
urban
theatres
provide
points
of
focus
within
their
locality
in
the
surrounding
cityscape
Probably
the
most
well
known
example
of
such
an
approach
is
Saint
Peter
s
Square
which
has
been
praised
as
a
masterstroke
of
Baroque
theatre
The
piazza
designed
by
Gian
Lorenzo
Bernini
is
formed
principally
by
two
colonnades
of
free
standing
columns
centred
on
an
Egyptian
obelisk
Bernini
s
own
favourite
design
was
his
oval
church
of
Sant
Andrea
al
Quirinale
decorated
with
polychome
marbles
and
an
ornate
gold
dome
His
secular
architecture
included
the
Palazzo
Barberini
based
on
plans
by
Maderno
and
the
Palazzo
Chigi
Odescalchi
1664
both
in
Rome
Sant
Ivo
alla
Sapienza
by
Francesco
Borromini
Bernini
s
rival
the
architect
Francesco
Borromini
produced
designs
that
deviated
dramatically
from
the
regular
compositions
of
the
ancient
world
and
Renaissance
His
building
plans
were
based
on
complex
geometric
figures
his
architectural
forms
were
unusual
and
inventive
and
he
employed
multi
layered
symbolism
in
his
architectural
designs
Borromini
s
architectural
spaces
seem
to
expand
and
contract
when
needed
showing
some
affinity
with
the
late
style
of
Michelangelo
His
iconic
masterpiece
is
the
diminutive
church
of
San
Carlo
alle
Quattro
Fontane
distinguished
by
a
complicated
plan
arrangement
that
is
partly
oval
and
partly
a
cross
and
so
has
complex
convex
concave
wall
rhythms
A
later
work
the
church
of
Sant
Ivo
alla
Sapienza
displays
the
same
playful
inventiveness
and
antipathy
to
the
flat
surface
epitomized
by
an
unusual
corkscrew
lantern
above
the
dome
Following
the
death
of
Bernini
in
1680
Carlo
Fontana
emerged
as
the
most
influential
architect
working
in
Rome
His
early
style
is
exemplified
by
the
slightly
concave
fa
ade
of
San
Marcello
al
Corso
Fontana
s
academic
approach
though
lacking
the
dazzling
inventiveness
of
his
Roman
predecessors
exerted
substantial
influence
on
Baroque
architecture
both
through
his
prolific
writings
and
through
a
number
of
architects
he
trained
who
would
disseminate
the
Baroque
idioms
throughout
18th
century
Europe
The
18th
century
saw
the
capital
of
Europe
s
architectural
world
transferred
from
Rome
to
Paris
The
Italian
Rococo
which
flourished
in
Rome
from
the
1720s
onward
was
profoundly
influenced
by
the
ideas
of
Borromini
The
most
talented
architects
active
in
Rome
Francesco
de
Sanctis
Spanish
Steps
1723
and
Filippo
Raguzzini
Piazza
Sant
Ignazio
1727
had
little
influence
outside
their
native
country
as
did
numerous
practitioners
of
the
Sicilian
Baroque
including
Giovanni
Battista
Vaccarini
Andrea
Palma
and
Giuseppe
Venanzio
Marvuglia
Basilica
di
Superga
near
Turin
by
Filippo
Juvarra
The
last
phase
of
Baroque
architecture
in
Italy
is
exemplified
by
Luigi
Vanvitelli
s
Caserta
Palace
reputedly
the
largest
building
erected
in
Europe
in
the
18th
century
Indebted
to
contemporary
French
and
Spanish
models
the
palace
is
skillfully
related
to
the
landscape
At
Naples
and
Caserta
Vanvitelli
practiced
a
sober
and
classicizing
academic
style
with
equal
attention
to
aesthetics
and
engineering
a
style
that
would
make
an
easy
transition
to
Neoclassicism
Northern
Italy
edit
In
the
north
of
Italy
the
monarchs
from
the
House
of
Savoy
were
particularly
receptive
to
the
new
style
They
employed
a
brilliant
triad
of
architects
Guarino
Guarini
Filippo
Juvarra
and
Bernardo
Vittone
to
illustrate
the
grandiose
political
ambitions
and
the
newly
acquired
royal
status
of
their
dynasty
Guarini
was
a
peripatetic
monk
who
combined
many
traditions
including
that
of
Gothic
architecture
to
create
irregular
structures
remarkable
for
their
oval
columns
and
unconventional
fa
ades
Building
upon
the
findings
of
contemporary
geometry
and
stereometry
Guarini
elaborated
the
concept
of
architectura
obliqua
which
approximated
Borromini
s
style
in
both
theoretical
and
structural
audacity
Guarini
s
Palazzo
Carignano
1679
may
have
been
the
most
flamboyant
application
of
the
Baroque
style
to
the
design
of
a
private
house
in
the
17th
century
Fluid
forms
weightless
details
and
the
airy
prospects
of
Juvarra
s
architecture
anticipated
the
art
of
Rococo
Although
his
practice
ranged
well
beyond
Turin
Juvarra
s
most
arresting
designs
were
created
for
Victor
Amadeus
II
of
Sardinia
The
visual
impact
of
his
Basilica
di
Superga
1717
derives
from
its
soaring
roof
line
and
masterful
placement
on
a
hill
above
Turin
The
rustic
ambiance
encouraged
a
freer
articulation
of
architectural
form
at
the
royal
hunting
lodge
of
the
Palazzina
di
Stupinigi
1729
Juvarra
finished
his
short
but
eventful
career
in
Madrid
where
he
worked
on
the
royal
palaces
at
La
Granja
and
Aranjuez
Among
the
many
who
were
profoundly
influenced
by
the
brilliance
and
diversity
of
Juvarra
and
Guarini
none
was
more
important
than
Bernardo
Vittone
This

Reconstruction
of
the
Wignacourt
Arch
one
of
the
earliest
Baroque
structures
in
Malta
The
Baroque
style
was
introduced
in
Malta
in
the
early
17th
century
possibly
by
the
Bolognese
architect
and
engineer
Bontadino
de
Bontadini
who
was
responsible
for
the
construction
of
the
Wignacourt
Aqueduct
between
1612
and
1615
The
earliest
Baroque
structures
in
Malta
were
the
decorative
elements
within
the
aqueduct
such
as
the
Wignacourt
Arch
and
several
fountains

Baroque
architecture
became
popular
after
Francesco
Bounamici
designed
the
Church
of
the
Jesuits
in
Valletta
in
1635
In
the
subsequent
decades
many
churches
public
buildings
city
gates
palaces
and
other
structures
were
constructed
or
rebuilt
in
this
style
New
churches
were
built
in
the
Baroque
style
while
older
ones
were
rebuilt
or
redecorated

Examples
include
the
interior
of
Saint
John
s
Co
Cathedral
which
was
completely
redesigned
by
Mattia
Preti
in
the
1660s
and
the
Church
of
Our
Lady
of
Victories
which
had
its
fa
ade
rebuilt
in
1752
The
architect
Lorenzo
Gaf
designed
many
Baroque
churches
between
the
1660s
and
the
1700s

Church
of

until

18th
and
early

As
Italian
Baroque
influences
penetrated
across
the
Pyrenees
they
gradually
superseded
in
popularity
the
restrained
classicizing
approach
of
Juan
de
Herrera
which
had
been
in
vogue
since
the
late
16th
century
As

L

suggest
the
artists
fluency
in
interpreting
traditional
motifs
of
Spanish
cathedral
architecture
in
the
Baroque
aesthetic
idiom
The
most
impressive
display
of
Churrigueresque
spatial
decoration
may
be
found
in
the
west
fa
ade
of
the
Cathedral
of
Santiago
de
Compostela
In
contrast
to
the
art
of
Northern
Europe
the
Spanish
art
of
the
period
appealed
to
the
emotions
rather
than
seeking
to
please
the
intellect
The
Churriguera
family
which
specialized
in
designing
altars
and
retables
revolted
against
the
sobriety
of
the
Herreresque
classicism
and
promoted
an
intricate
exaggerated
almost
capricious
style
of
surface
decoration
known
as
the
Churrigueresque
Within
half
a
century
they
transformed
Salamanca
into
an
exemplary
Churrigueresque
city
Among
the
highlights
of
the
style
the
interiors
of
the
Granada
Charterhouse
offer
some
of
the
most
impressive
combinations
of
space
and
light
in
18th
century
Europe
Integrating
sculpture
and
architecture
even
more

Narciso

chiaroscuro

in
his
Transparente

the
Toledo
Cathedral
Facade
of
the
University
of
Valladolid

The
development
of
the
style
passed
through
three
phases
Between
1680
and
1720
the
Churriguera
popularized
Guarini
s
blend
of
Solomonic
columns
and
composite
order
known
as
the
supreme
order
Between
1720
and
1760
the
Churrigueresque
column
or
estipite
in
the
shape
of
an
inverted
cone
or
obelisk
was
established
as
a
central
element
of
ornamental
decoration
The
years
from
1760
to
1780
saw
a
gradual
shift
of
interest
away
from
twisted
movement
and
excessive
ornamentation
toward
a
neoclassical
balance
and
sobriety
Two
of
the
most
eye
catching
creations
of
Spanish
Baroque
are
the
energetic
fa
ades
of
the
University
of
Valladolid
Diego
Tom
1716
1718
and
Hospicio
de
San
Fernando
in
Madrid
Pedro
de
Ribera
1722
whose
curvilinear
extravagance
seems
to
herald
Antonio
Gaud
and
Art
Nouveau
In
this
case
as
in
many
others
the
design
involves
a
play
of
tectonic
and
decorative
elements
with
little
relation
to
structure
and
function
The
focus
of
the
florid
ornamentation
is
an
elaborately
sculptured
surround
to
a
main
doorway
If
we
remove
the
intricate
maze
of
broken
pediments
undulating
cornices
stucco
shells
inverted
tapers
and
garlands
from
the
rather
plain

is

Brazilian

rarely
surpassed
their

in
ostentation
The

The

secular
architecture
was
France
where
the
open
three
wing
layout
of
the
palace
was
established
as
the
canonical
solution
as
early
as
the
16th
century
But
it
was
the
Palais
du
Luxembourg
by
Salomon
de

that
determined
the
sober
and
classicizing
direction
that
French
Baroque
architecture
was
to
take
For
the
first
time
the
corps
de
logis
was
emphasized
as
the
representative
main
part
of
the
building
while
the
side
wings
were
treated
as
hierarchically
inferior
and
appropriately
scaled
down

has

overblown
decorative
effects
so
typical
of
contemporary
Rome
Italian
Baroque
influence
is
muted
and
relegated
to
the
field
of
decorative
ornamentation
The
next
step
in
the
development
of
European
residential
architecture
involved
the
integration
of
the
gardens
in
the
composition
of
the
palace
as
is
exemplified
by
Vaux
le
Vicomte
where
the
architect
Louis
Le
Vau
the
designer
Charles
Le
Brun
and
the
gardener
Andr
Le
N
tre
complemented
one
another
From
the
main
cornice
to
a
low
plinth
the
miniature
palace
is
clothed
in
the
so
called
colossal
order
which
makes
the
structure
look
more
impressive
The
creative
collaboration
of
Le
Vau
and
Le
N
tre
marked
the
arrival
of
the
Magnificent
Manner
which
allowed
to
extend
Baroque
architecture
outside
the
palace
walls
and
transform
the
surrounding
landscape
into
an
immaculate
mosaic
of
expansive
vistas
Les
Invalides
in
Paris
by
Jules
Hardouin
Mansart
1676
The
same
three
artists
scaled
this
concept
to
monumental
proportions
in
the
royal
hunting
lodge
and
later
main
residence
at
Versailles
On
a
far
grander
scale
the
palace
is
an
exaggerated
and
somewhat
repetitive
version
of
Vaux
le
Vicomte
It
was
both
the
most
grandiose
and
the
most
imitated
residential
building
of
the
17th
century
Mannheim
Nordkirchen
and
Drottningholm
were
among
many
foreign
residences
for
which
Versailles
provided
a
model
The
final
expansion
of
Versailles
was
superintended
by
Jules
Hardouin
Mansart
whose
key
design
is
the
Dome
des
Invalides
generally
regarded
as
the
most
important
French
church
of
the
century
Hardouin
Mansart
profited
from
his
uncle
s
instruction
and
plans
to
instill
the
edifice
with
an
imperial
grandeur
unprecedented
in
the
countries
north
of
Italy
The
majestic
hemispherical
dome
balances
the
vigorous
vertical
thrust
of
the
orders
which
do
not
accurately
convey
the
structure
of
the
interior
The
younger
architect
not
only
revived
the
harmony
and
balance
associated
with
the
work
of
the
elder
Mansart
but
also
set
the
tone
for
Late
Baroque
French
architecture
with
its
grand
ponderousness
and
increasing
concessions
to
academicism
The
reign
of
Louis
XV
saw
a
reaction
against
the
official
Louis
XIV
Style
in
the
shape
of
a
more
delicate
and
intimate
manner
known
as
Rococo
The
style
was
pioneered
by
Nicolas
Pineau
who
collaborated
with
Hardouin
Mansart
on
the
interiors
of
the
royal
Ch
teau
de
Marly
Further
elaborated
by
Pierre
Le
Pautre
and
Juste
Aur
le
Meissonier
the
genre
pittoresque
culminated
in
the
interiors
of
the
Petit
Ch
teau
at
Chantilly
c
1722
and
H
tel
de
Soubise
in
Paris
c
1732
where
a
fashionable
emphasis
on
the
curvilinear
went
beyond
all
reasonable
measure
while
sculpture
paintings
furniture
and
porcelain
tended
to
overshadow
architectural
divisions
of
the
interior

Baroque
architecture
in
the
Southern
Netherlands
developed
rather
differently
from
in
the
Protestant
North
After
the
Twelve
Years
Truce
the
Southern
Netherlands
remained
in
Catholic
hands
ruled
by
the
Spanish
Habsburg
Kings
Important
architectural
projects
were
set
up
in
the
spirit
of
the
Counter
Reformation
In
them
florid
decorative
detailing
was
more
tightly
knit
to
the
structure
thus
precluding
concerns
of
superfluity
A
remarkable
convergence
of
Spanish
French
and
Dutch
Baroque
aesthetics
may
be
seen
in
the
Abbey
of
Averbode
1667
Another
characteristic
example
is
the
Church
of
St
Michel
at
Louvain
with
its
exuberant
two

clusters
of
half
columns
and
the
complex

The
greatest
practitioner
of
the
Spanish

was
a

Rodr
guez
responsible
for
the
dazzling
interior
of
the
Basilica
of
Our
Lady
of
the
Pillar
in
Zaragoza
1750
Some
Flemish
architects
such
as
Wenceslas
Cobergher
were
trained
in
Italy
and
their
works
were
inspired
by
architects
such
as
Jacopo
Barozzi
da
Vignola
and
Giacomo
della
Porta
Cobergher
s
most
major
project
was
the
Basilica
of
Our
Lady
of
Scherpenheuvel
which
he
designed
as
the
center
of
a
new
town
in
the
form
of
a
heptagon
The
influence
of
the
painter
Peter
Paul
Rubens
on
architecture
was
very
important
With
his
book
I
Palazzi
di
Genova
he
introduced
novel
Italian
models
for
the
conception
of
profane
buildings
and
decoration
in
the
Southern
Netherlands
The
courtyard
and
portico
of
his
own
house
in
Antwerp
Rubenshuis
are
good
examples
of
his
architectural
activity
He
also
took
part
in
the
decoration
of
the
Antwerp
Jesuit
Church
now
Carolus
Borromeuskerk
where
he
introduced
a
lavish
Baroque
decoration
integrating
sculpture
and
painting

There
is
little
Baroque
about
Dutch
architecture
of
the
17th
century
The
architecture
of
the
first
republic
in
Northern
Europe
was
meant
to
reflect
democratic
values
by
quoting
extensively
from
classical
antiquity
Like
contemporary
developments
in
England
Dutch
Palladianism
is
marked
by
sobriety
and
restraint
Two
leading
architects
Jacob
van
Campen
and
Pieter
Post
used
such
eclectic
elements
as
giant
order
pilasters
gable
roofs
central
pediments
and
vigorous
steeples
in
a
coherent
combination
that
anticipated
Wren
s
Classicism
The
most
ambitious
constructions
of
the
period
included
the
seats
of
self
government
in
Amsterdam
1646
and
Maastricht
1658
designed
by
Campen
and
Post
respectively
On
the
other
hand
the
residences
of
the
House
of
Orange
are
closer
to
a
typical
burgher
mansion
than
to
a
royal
palace
Two
of
these
Huis
ten
Bosch
and
Mauritshuis
are
symmetrical
blocks
with
large
windows
stripped
of
ostentatious
Baroque
flourishes
and
mannerisms
The
same
austerely
geometrical
effect
is
achieved
without
great
cost
or
pretentious
effects
at
the
Stadholder
s
summer
residence
of
Het
Loo
The
Dutch
Republic
was
one
of
the
great
powers
of
17th
century
Europe
and
its
influence
on
European
architecture
was
by
no
means
negligible
Dutch
architects
were
employed
on
important
projects
in
Northern
Germany
Scandinavia
and
Russia
disseminating
their
ideas
in
those
countries
The
Dutch
colonial
architecture
once
flourishing

potent
in

made
little
impact
in

during

For

between
the
death
of
Inigo
Jones
in
1652
and
Christopher
Wren
s
visit
to
Paris
in
1665
there
was
no
English
architect
of
the
accepted
premier
class
Unsurprisingly
general
interest
in
European
architectural
developments
was
slight
It
was
Wren
who
presided
over
the
genesis
of
the
English
Baroque
manner
which
differed
from
the
continental
models
by
a
clarity
of
design
and
a
subtle
taste
for
classicism
Following
the
Great
Fire
of
London
Wren
rebuilt
fifty
three
churches
where
Baroque
aesthetics
are
apparent
primarily
in
dynamic
structure
and
multiple
changing
views
His
most
ambitious
work
was
St
Paul
s
Cathedral
which
bears
comparison
with
the
most
effulgent
domed
churches
of
Italy
and
France
In
this
majestically
proportioned
edifice
the
Palladian
tradition
of
Inigo
Jones
is
fused
with
contemporary
continental
sensibilities
in
masterly
equilibrium

to

by
William
Talman
at
Chatsworth
starting
in
1687
The
culmination
of
Baroque
architectural
forms
comes
with
Sir
John
Vanbrugh
and
Nicholas
Hawksmoor
Each
was
capable
of
a
fully
developed
architectural
statement
yet
they
preferred
to
work
in
tandem
most
notably
at
Castle
Howard
1699
and
Blenheim
Palace
1705
Although
these
two
palaces
may
appear
somewhat
ponderous
or
turgid
to
Italian
eyes
their
heavy
embellishment
and
overpowering
mass
captivated
the
British
public
albeit
for
a
short
while
Castle

assembly
of
restless
masses
dominated
by
a
cylindrical
domed
tower
which
would
not

Blenheim

a
more
solid
construction
where
the
massed
stone
of
the
arched

and
the
huge
solid
portico
becomes
the
main
ornament
Vanbrugh

work
was
Seaton

a
comparatively
modest

unique
in
the

Vanbrugh
a

achieved
the
peak
of

once

highlighting

Despite
his
efforts
Baroque
was
never
truly

taste

In

the

Although
the

architect
Elias
Holl
1573
1646
and
some
theoretists
including
Joseph
Furttenbach
the
Elder
already
practiced
the
Baroque
style
they
remained
without
successors
due
to
the
ravages
of
the
Thirty
Years
War
From
about
1650
on
construction
work
resumed
and
secular
and
ecclesiastical
architecture
were
of
equal
importance
During
an
initial
phase
master
masons
from
southern
Switzerland
and
northern
Italy
the
so
called
magistri
Grigioni
and
the
Lombard
master
masons
particularly
the
Carlone
family
from
Val
d
Intelvi
dominated
the
field
However
Austria
came
soon
to
develop
its
own
characteristic
Baroque
style
during
the
last
third
of
the
17th
century
Johann
Bernhard
Fischer
von
Erlach
was
impressed
by
Bernini
He
forged
a
new
Imperial
style
by
compiling
architectural
motifs
from
the
entire
history
most
prominently
seen
in
his
church
of
St
Charles
Borromeo
in
Vienna
Johann
Lucas
von
Hildebrandt
also
had
an
Italian
training
He
developed
a
highly
decorative
style
particularly
in
fa
ade
architecture
which
exerted
strong
influences
on
southern
Germany
St

Church
in

Austria
Frequently
the
Southern
German
Baroque
is
distinguished
from
the
Northern
German
Baroque
which
is
more
properly
the
distinction
between
the
Catholic
and
the
Protestant
Baroque
In
the
Catholic
South
the
Jesuit
church
of
St
Michael
in
Munich
was
the
first
to
bring
Italian
style
across
the
Alps
However
its
influence
on
the
further
development
of
church
architecture
was
rather
limited
A
much
more
practical
and
more
adaptable
model
of
church
architecture
was
provided
by
the
Jesuit
church
in
Dillingen
the
wall
pillar
church
a
barrel
vaulted
nave
accompanied
by
large
open
chapels
separated
by

As
opposed
to
St
Michael
s
in
Munich
the
chapels
almost
reach
the
height
of
the
nave
in
the
wall
pillar
church
and
their
vault
usually
transverse
barrel
vaults
springs
from
the
same
level
as
the
main
vault
of
the
nave
The
chapels
provide
ample
lighting
seen
from
the
entrance
of
the
church
the
wall
pillars
form
a
theatrical
setting
for
the
side
altars
The
wall
pillar
church
was
further
developed
by
the
Vorarlberg
school
as
well
as
the
master
masons
of
Bavaria
This
new
church
also
integrated
well
with
the
hall
church
model
of
the
German
late
Gothic
age
The
wall
pillar
church
continued
to
be
used
throughout
the
18th
century
e
g
even
in
the
early
neo
classical
church
of
Rot

without
any
structural
changes
such
as
the
church
at
Dillingen
Interior
of

church
in

However
the
Catholic
South
also
received
influences
from
other
sources
such
as
the
so
called
radical
Baroque
of
Bohemia
The
radical
Baroque
of
Christoph
Dientzenhofer
and
his
son
Kilian
Ignaz
Dientzenhofer
both
residing
at
Prague
was
inspired
by
examples
from
northern
Italy
particularly
by
the
works
of
Guarino
Guarini
It
is
characterized
by
the
curvature
of
walls
and

of

Palace

During
the
late

century
the
most
famous
architect
in
the
Commonwealth
was
the
Dutch
born
Tylman
van
Gameren
who
at
the
age
of
28
settled
in
Poland
the
Crown
of
the
Commonwealth
and
worked
for
Queen

Tylman
left
behind
a
lifelong
legacy
of
buildings
that
are
regarded
as
gems
of
Polish
Baroque
architecture
they
include
among
others
the
Ostrogski
Palace
Otwock
Palace
Branicki
Palace
St
Kazimierz
Church
and
the
Church
of
St
Anne
By
the
end
of
the
century
Polish
Baroque
influences
crossed
the
Dnieper
river
into
the
Cossack
Hetmanate
where
it
gave
birth
to
a
particular
style
of
architecture
known
as
the
Cossack
Baroque
20
Also
a
notable
style
of
baroque
architecture
emerged
in
the
18th
century
with
the
work
of
Johann
Christoph
Glaubitz
who
was
assigned
to
rebuild
the
Grand
Duchy
of
Lithuania
s
capital
of
Vilnius
The
style
was
therefore
named
Vilnian
Baroque
and
Old
Vilnius
was
named
the
City
of
Baroque
21
The
most
notable
buildings
by
Glaubitz
in
Vilnius
are
the
Church
of
St
Catherine
started
in
1743
22
the
Church
of
the
Ascension
started
in
1750
the
Church
of
St
John
the
monastery
gate
and
the
towers
of
the
Church
of
the
Holy
Trinity
The
magnificent
and
dynamic
Baroque
facade
of
the
formerly
Gothic
Church
of
St
Johns
is
mentioned
among
his
best
works
Many
church
interiors
including
the
one
of
the
Great
Synagogue
of
Vilna
were
reconstructed
by
Glaubitz
as
well
as
the
Town
Hall
build
in
1769
Notable
buildings
of
Vilnian
Baroque
in
other
places
are
Saint
Sophia
Cathedral
in
Polotsk

rebuilt
between
1738
and
1765

Ukrainian
Baroque
is
an
architectural
style
that
emerged
in
Ukraine
during
the
Hetmanate
era
in
the
17th
and
18th
centuries
Ukrainian
Baroque
is
distinct
from
the
Western
European
Baroque
in
having
more
moderate
ornamentation
and
simpler
forms
and
as
such
was
considered
more
constructivist
One
of
the
unique
features
of
the
Ukrainian
baroque
were
bud
and
pear
shaped
domes
that
were
later
borrowed
by
the
similar
Naryshkin
baroque
23
Many
Ukrainian
Baroque
buildings
have
been
preserved
including
several
buildings
in
Kiev
Pechersk
Lavra
and
the
Vydubychi
Monastery
The
best
examples
of
Baroque
painting
are
the
church
paintings
in
the
Holy
Trinity
Church
of
the
Kiev
Pechersk
Lavra
Rapid
development
in
engraving
techniques
occurred
during
the
Ukrainian
Baroque
period
Advances

system
of

In
Russia
Baroque
architecture
passed
through
three
stages
the
early
Moscow
Baroque
with
elegant
white
decorations
on
red
brick
walls
of
rather
traditional
churches
the
mature
Petrine
Baroque
mostly
imported
from
the
Low
Countries
and
the
late
Rastrelliesque
Baroque
which
was
in
the
words
of
William
Brumfield
extravagant
in
design
and
execution
yet
ordered
by
the
rhythmic
insistence
of
massed
columns
and
Baroque
statuary
The
first
baroque
churches
were
built
in
the
estates
of
the
Naryshkin
family
of
Moscow
boyars
It
was
the
family
of
Natalia
Naryshkina
Peter
the
Great
s
mother
Most
notable
in
this
category
of
small
suburban
churches
were
the
Intercession
in
Fili
1693
96
the
Holy
Tritity
church
in
Troitse
Lykovo
1690
1695
and
the
Saviour
in
Ubory
1694
97
They
were
built
in
red
brick
with
profuse
detailed
decoration
in
white
stone
The
belfry
was
not
any
more
placed
beside
the
church
as
was
common
in
the
17th
century
but
on
the
facade
itself
usually
surmounting
the
octagonal
central
church
and
producing
daring
vertical
compositions
As
the
style
gradually
spread
around
Russia
many
monasteries
were
remodeled
after
the
latest
fashion
The
most
delightful
of
these
were
the
Novodevichy
Convent
and
the
Donskoy
Monastery
in
Moscow
as
well
as
Krutitsy
metochion
and
Solotcha
Cloister
near
Riazan
Civic
architecture
also
sought
to
conform
to
the
baroque
aesthetics
e
g
the
Sukharev
Tower
in
Moscow
and
there
is
also
a
neo
form
of
this
style
like
the
Principal
Medicine
Store
on
Red
Square
The
most
important
architects
associated
with
the
Naryshkin
Baroque
were
Yakov
Bukhvostov
and
Peter
Potapov
Petrine
Baroque
is
a
name
applied
by
art
historians
to
a
style
of
Baroque
architecture
and
decoration
favoured
by
Peter
the
Great
and
employed
to
design
buildings
in
the
newly
founded
Russian
capital
Saint
Petersburg
under
this
monarch
and
his
immediate
successors
Unlike
contemporaneous
Naryshkin
Baroque
favoured
in
Moscow
the
Petrine
Baroque
represented
a
drastic
rupture
with
Byzantine
traditions
that
had
dominated
Russian
architecture
for
almost
a
millennium
Its
chief
practitioners
Domenico
Trezzini
Andreas
Schl
ter
and
Mikhail
Zemtsov
drew
inspiration
from
a
rather
modest
Dutch
Danish
and
Swedish
architecture
of
the
time
Extant
examples
of
the
style
in
St
Petersburg
are
the
Peter
and
Paul
Cathedral
the
Twelve
Colleges
the
Kunstkamera
Kikin
Hall
and
Menshikov
Palace
The
Petrine
Baroque
structures
outside
St
Petersburg
are
scarce
they
include
the
Menshikov
Tower
in
Moscow
and
the
Kadriorg
Palace
in
Tallinn
Scandinavia
edit
French
ch
teaux
of
the
17th
century
provided
models
for
numerous
country
houses
across
Northern
Europe
Tessin
s
Drottningholm
Palace
illustrates
the
proximity
between
French
and
Swedish
architectural
practice
Amalienborg
Palace
a
Baroque
quarter
in
the
center
of
Copenhagen
During
the
golden
age
of
the
Swedish
Empire
the
architecture
of
Nordic
countries
was
dominated
by
the
Swedish
court
architect
Nicodemus
Tessin
the
Elder
and
his
son
Nicodemus
Tessin
the
Younger
Their
aesthetic
was
readily
adopted
across
the
Baltic
in
Copenhagen
and
Saint
Petersburg
Born
in
Germany
Tessin
the
Elder
endowed
Sweden
with
a
truly
national
style
a
well
balanced
mixture
of
contemporary
French
and
medieval
Hanseatic
elements
His
designs
for
the
royal
manor
of
Drottningholm
seasoned
French
prototypes
with
Italian
elements
while
retaining
some
peculiarly
Nordic
features
such
as
the
hipped
roof
s
teritak
Tessin
the
Younger
shared
his
father
s
enthusiasm
for
discrete
palace
fa
ades
His
design
for
the
Stockholm
Palace
draws
so
heavily
on
Bernini
s
unexecuted
plans
for
the
Louvre
that
one
could
well
imagine
it
standing
in
Naples
Vienna
or
Saint
Petersburg
Another
example
of
the
so
called
International
Baroque
based
on
Roman
models
with
little
concern
for
national
specifics
is
the
Royal
Palace
of
Madrid
The
same
approach
is
manifested
is
Tessin
s
polychrome
domeless
Kalmar
Cathedral
a
skillful
pastiche
of
early
Italian
Baroque
clothed
in
a
giant
order
of
paired
Ionic
pilasters
It
was
not
until
the
mid
18th
century
that
Danish
and
Russian
architecture
were
emancipated
from
Swedish
influence
A
milestone
of
this
late
period
is
Nicolai
Eigtved
s
design
for
a
new
district
of
Copenhagen
centred
on
the
Amalienborg
Palace
The
palace
is
composed
of
four
rectangular
mansions
originally
owned
by
four
of
Denmark
s
greatest
noble
families
arranged
across
the
angles
of
an
octagonal
square
The
restrained
fa
ades
of
the
mansions
hark
back
to
French
antecedents
while
their
interiors
contain
some
of
the
finest
Rococo
decoration
in
Northern
Europe
Amalienborg
Palace
has
served
as
the
residence
of
the
Danish
royal
family

As
reforms
and
innovations
to
modernize
the
country
came
out
in
18th
and
19th
century
various
architecture
styles
were
used

one
of
them
was
the
Baroque

As
Turkish
architecture
which
is
also
a
combination
of
Islamic
and
Byzantine
architecture
combined
with
Baroque
a
new
style
called
Ottoman
Baroque
appeared
Baroque
architecture
is
mostly
seen
in
mosques
and
palaces
built
in
this
centuries
The
Ortak
y
Mosque
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
Ottoman
Baroque
Architecture
The
Tanzimat
Era
caused
more
architectural
development
The
architectural
change
continued
with
Sultan
Mahmud
II
one
of
the
most
reformist
sultans
in
Turkish
History
One
of
his
sons
Sultan
Abd
lmecid
and
his
family
left
the
Topkap
Palace
and
moved
to
the
Dolmabah
e
Palace
which
is
the
first
European
style
palace
in
the
country
Baroque
architecture
in
Istanbul
was
mostly
used
in
palaces
near
the
Bosphorus
and
Golden
Horn
Beyo
lu
was
one
of
the
places
that
Baroque
and
other
European
style
architecture
buildings
were
largely
used
The
famous
streets
called
Istiklal
Avenue
Ni
anta
Bankalar
Caddesi
consist
of
these
architecture
style
apartments
The
Ottoman
flavour
gives
it
its
unique
atmosphere
which
also
distinguishes
it
from
the
later
colonial
Baroque
styles
largely
used
in
the
Middle
East
especially
Lebanon
Later
and
more
mature
Baroque
forms
in
Istanbul
can
be
found
in
the
gates
of
the
Dolmabah
e
Palace
which
also
has
a
very
eastern
flavour
combining
Baroque
Romantic
and
Oriental

The
bronze
crucifix
by
Rudolf
Gr
schel
of
1963
The
first
church
building
was
probably
built
in
the
years
1120
1130
on
the
site
of
the
second
northern
Nuremberg
royal
court
The
royal
courts
administered
royal
possessions
agriculture
and
forestry
Thus
it
had
the
status
of
a
royal
church
Around
the
year
1140
Emperor
Conrad
III
and
his
wife
Gertrud
raised
the
foundation
to
the
rank
of
a
benedictine
abbey
and
endowed
it
generously
They
made
Carus
Abbot
of
the
Scots
Monastery
Regensburg
their
royal
chaplain
and
the
first
Abbot
of
St
Egidien
The
monastery
was
rich
immediately
and
subordinate
in
secular
terms
only
to
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
The
first
monks
came
from
the
Scots
Monastery
Regensburg
and
St
James
s
Abbey
W
rzburg
2
It
was
a
three
aisled
basilica
in
the
Romanesque
style
In
1418
the
monastery
was
impoverished
and
in
debt
The
altar
vessels
were
mortgaged
and
the
Scots
Monastery
Regensburg
no
longer
guaranteed
the
debt
The
abbey
was
taken
over
by
German
Benedictines
from
Reichenbach
After
the
take
over
the
monastery
was
partially
rebuilt
and
the
church
and
chapels
were
renovated
The
Irish
monks
had
to
come
to
terms
with
the
new
regime
or
leave
the
abbey
At
the
Reformation
in
1525
the
monastery
was
dissolved
and
the
monastic
estates
transferred
to
the
city
authorities
After
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
there
were
two
unsuccessful
attempts
to
recover
the
former
monastic
estates
for
the
Benedictine
order
firstly
in
1578
by
the
Scottish
Bishop
John
Lesley
on
behalf
of
Mary
Queen
of
Scots
and
from
1629
to
1631
by
a
Commission
for
the
Prince
Bishopric
of
Bamberg
to
implement
a
Roman
Catholic
Restitution
Edict
On
6
and
7
July
1696
a
fire
destroyed
the
monastery
and
church
The
church
was
rebuilt
in
the
baroque
style
The
foundation
stone
was
laid
on
14
October
1711
The
architects
were
Johann
Trost
and
Gottlieb
Trost
It
was
the
largest
construction
project
in
Nuremberg
in
the
18th
century
The
stucco
decorations
were
done
by
Donato
Polli
The
frescos
were
painted
by
Daniel
Preisler
and
Johann
Martin
Schuster
The
church
was
badly
damaged
during
the
Second
World
War
in
an
air
raid
on
2
January
1945
The
roof
on
the
nave
crossing
transepts
and
choir
collapsed
and
the
outer
walls
were
badly
damaged
It
was
rebuilt
between
1946
and
1959
3
by
the
Nuremberg
architect
Rudolf
Gr
schel
in
an
economic
interpretative
way
as
the
costs
to
reconstruct
the
baroque
interior
with
its
ornate
detail
was
unaffordable
at
the
time

The
War
of
the
Austrian
Succession
German
sterreichischer
Erbfolgekrieg
1740
48
involved
most
of
the
powers
of
Europe
over
the
question
of
Maria
Theresa
s
succession
to
the
Habsburg
Monarchy
The
war
included
King
George
s
War
in
British
America
the
War
of
Jenkins
Ear
which
formally
began
on
23
October
1739
the
First
Carnatic
War
in
India
the
Jacobite
rising
of
1745
in
Scotland
and
the
First
and
Second
Silesian
Wars
The
war
began
under
the
pretext
that
Maria
Theresa
was
ineligible
to
succeed
to
the
Habsburg
thrones
of
her
father
Charles
VI
because
Salic
law
precluded
royal
inheritance
by
a
woman
In
practice
the
challenge
of
eligibility
was
an
excuse
put
forward
by
Prussia
and
France
to
challenge
Habsburg
power
Austria
was
supported
by
Great
Britain
and
the
Dutch
Republic
the
traditional
enemies
of
France
as
well
as
the
Kingdom
of
Sardinia
and
the
Electorate
of
Saxony
France
and
Prussia
were
allied
with
the
Electorate
of
Bavaria
Spain
which
had
been
at
war
with
Britain
over
colonies
and
trade
ever
since
1739
entered
the
war
on
the
Continent
to
re
establish
its
influence
in
northern
Italy
further
reversing
an
Austrian
dominance
over
the
Italian
peninsula
that
had
been
achieved
at
Spain
s
expense
as
a
consequence
of
Spain
s
war
of
succession
earlier
in
the
18th
century
The
war
ended
with
the
Treaty
of
Aix
la
Chapelle
in
1748
by
which
Maria
Theresa
was
confirmed
as
Archduchess
of
Austria
and
Queen
of
Hungary
but
Prussia
retained
control
of
Silesia
But
the
peace
was
soon
to
be
shattered
when
Austria
s
desire
to
recapture
Silesia
intertwined
with
the
great
political
changes
in
Europe
which
ended
up
with
the
Seven
Years
War

The
immediate
cause
of
the
War
of
the
Austrian
Succession
was
the
death
in
1740
of
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
Charles
VI
and
the
inheritance
of
Hapsburg
lands
in
Austria
Hungary
Croatia
the
Netherlands
Bohemia
and
Italy
often
collectively
referred
to
as
Austria
When
Charles
succeeded
his
elder
brother
Joseph
I
in
1711
he
was
the
last
male
Hapsburg
heir
in
the
direct
line
this
meant
their
lands
would
be
divided
on
his
death
as
Salic
law
prevented
women
inheriting
in
their
own
right
A
family
issue
became
a
European
one
due
to
tensions
within
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
originally
a
loose
confederation
of
Germanic
states
with
the
position
of
Emperor
filled
by
the
votes
of
seven
of
the
most
significant
The
Thirty
Years
War
of
1618
48
divided
the
Empire
into
Protestant
and
Catholic
regions
substantially
weakening
the
bonds
holding
it
together
while
by
the
mid
18th
century
states
like
Bavaria
Prussia
and
Saxony
had
increased
dramatically
in
both
size
and
power
The
same
was
also
true
of
the
Hapsburgs
who
now
viewed
the
title
of
Emperor
as
being
hereditary
in
practice
if
not
principle
Lothar
III
was
the
last
non
Hapsburg
Emperor
in
1138
It
was
these
centrifugal
forces
that
led
to
a
war
which
reshaped
the
traditional
European
balance
of
power
the
various
legal
claims
were
largely
pretexts
and
seen
as
such
1
The
Pragmatic
Sanction
of
1713
secured
the
integrity
of
the
Hapsburg
inheritance
by
allowing
a
female
successor
a
principle
approved
by
the
various
Hapsburg
territories
the
Imperial
Diet
Spain
Russia
Prussia
Britain
and
France
2
However
when
his
own
daughter
Maria
Theresa
was
born
in
1717
Charles
had
disinherited
his
two
nieces
Maria
Josepha
and
Maria
Amalia
married
respectively
to
the
rulers
of
Bavaria
and
Saxony
who
now
refused
to
be
bound
by
the
decision
of
the
Imperial
Diet
In
addition
despite
publicly
agreeing
to
the
Pragmatic
Sanction
in
1735
France
then
signed
a
secret
treaty
with
Bavaria
in
1738
promising
to
back
the
just
claims
of
Charles
Albert
of
Bavaria
3
Charles
responded
by
supporting
first
the
claim
of
Augustus
Elector
of
Saxony
to
the
Polish
throne
in
the
War
of
the
Polish
Succession
then
more
disastrously
Russia
in
the
Russo
Turkish
War
of
1735
1739
Their
losses
of
men
money
and
territory
in
these
two
conflicts
of
low
strategic
value
weakened
Austria
at
exactly
the
wrong
time
while
Charles
also
failed
to
prepare
Maria
Theresa
for
her
new
role
excluding
her
from
any
role
in
government
many
diplomats
and
statesmen
were
sceptical
Austria
could
survive
the
widely
anticipated
contest
that
would
follow
Charles
death
which
finally
occurred
in
October
1740

Strategies
edit
All
the
participants
of
the
War
of
the
Austrian
Succession
Blue
Austria
Great
Britain
the
United
Provinces
with
allies
Green
Prussia
Spain
France
with
allies
For
much
of
the
eighteenth
century
France
approached
its
wars
in
the
same
way
It
would
let
its
colonies
defend
themselves
or
would
offer
only
minimal
help
sending
them
only
limited
numbers
of
troops
or
inexperienced
soldiers
anticipating
that
fights
for
the
colonies
would
likely
be
lost
anyway
5
This
strategy
was
to
a
degree
forced
upon
France
geography
coupled
with
the
superiority
of
the
British
navy
made
it
difficult
for
the
French
navy
to
provide
significant
supplies
and
support
to
French
colonies
6
Similarly
several
long
land
borders
made
an
effective
domestic
army
imperative
for
any
ruler
of
France
7
Given
these
military
necessities
the
French
government
unsurprisingly
based
its
strategy
overwhelmingly
on
the
army
in
Europe
it
would
keep
most
of
its
army
on
the
European
continent
hoping
that
such
a
force
would
be
victorious
closer
to
home
7
At
the
end
of
the
war
France
gave
back
its
European
conquests
and
recovered
such
lost
overseas
possessions
as
Louisbourg
largely
restoring
the
status
quo
ante
as
far
as
France
was
concerned
8
The
British
by
inclination
as
well
as
for
pragmatic
reasons
had
tended
to
avoid
large
scale
commitments
of
troops
on
the
Continent
9
They
sought
to
offset
the
disadvantage
this
created
in
Europe
by
allying
themselves
with
one
or
more
Continental
powers
whose
interests
were
antithetical
to
those
of
their
enemies
particularly
France
For
the
War
of
the
Austrian
Succession
the
British
were
allied
with
Austria
by
the
time
of
the
Seven
Years
War
they
were
allied
with
its
enemy
Prussia
In
marked
contrast
to
France
Britain
strove
to
actively
prosecute
the
war
in
the
colonies
once
it
became
involved
in
the
war
taking
full
advantage
of
its
naval
power
10
The
British
pursued
a
dual
strategy
of
naval
blockade
and
bombardment
of
enemy
ports
and
also
utilized
their
ability
to
move
troops
by
sea
to
the
utmost
11
They
would
harass
enemy
shipping
and
attack
enemy
outposts
frequently
using
colonists
from
nearby
British
colonies
in
the
effort
This
plan
worked
better
in
North
America
than
in
Europe
but
set
the
stage
for
the
Seven
Years

Prussia
in

was
an
emerging
power
a
small
but
well
organized
state
whose
new
king
Frederick
II
wanted
to
unify
the
disparate
and
scattered
holdings
of
his
crown
by
gathering
intervening
lands
into
a
unified
contiguous
state
Prince
Frederick
had
been
only
28
years
of
age
on
31
May
1740
when
his
father
Frederick
William
I
died
and
Prince
Frederick
ascended
to
the
throne

Although
Prussia
and
Austria
had
been
allies
in

concluded
only
two
years
before
the
interests
of
the
two
countries
diverged
when
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
Charles
VI
died
on
20
October
1740
Neither
Frederick
nor
his
father
had
ever
been
fond
of
Austria
and
its
various
snubs
against
Prussia
such
as
offering
them
the
duchies
of
Julich
and
Berg
in
return
for
an
alliance
only
to
renege
later
13
Emperor
Charles
VI
had
made
provision
for
the
succession
of
his
daughter
Maria
Theresa
to
the
throne
as
Empress
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
Although
the
Salic
law
prevented
succession
through
the
female
line
during
his
lifetime
Emperor
Charles
VI
obtained
consent
from
several
of
the
individual
German
states
that
were
a
part
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
for
his
Pragmatic
Sanction
of
1713
which
circumvented
the
Salic
Law
to
allow
his
daughter
to
succeed
to
the
throne
14
While
the
Austrian
Habsburg
Monarchy
was
distracted
by
the
succession
Frederick
upon
coming
to
the
throne
rejected
the
Pragmatic
Sanction
of
1713
and
opportunistically
invaded
Silesia
on
16
December
1740
15
In
support
of
his
invasion
of
Silesia
Frederick
also
used
a
questionable
interpretation
of
a
treaty
1537
between
the
Hohenzollerns
and
the
Piasts
of
Brieg
as
pretext
What
Frederick
really
feared
was
that
other
princes
of
Europe
were
preparing
to
exploit
the
succession
struggle
to
acquire
Habsburg
possessions
for
themselves
and
or
diminish
the
power
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
In
particular
Frederick
feared
that
Augustus
III
Elector
of
Saxony
and
King
of
Poland
was
preparing
to
seize
Silesia
for
himself
to
unite
Saxony
and
Poland
16
The
only
recent
combat
experience
of
the
Prussian
Army
was
their
participation
in
the
War
of
the
Polish
Succession
Rhine
campaign
of
1733
1735
in
which
the
Prussians
had
largely
been
kept
out
of
combat
Nobody
in
the
court
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
trusted
the
motives
of
the
new
rising
power
of
Prussia
and
therefore
citation
needed
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
did
not
call
on
the
Prussians
who
were
vassals
dubious
discuss
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
for
military
support
of
the
Empire
Accordingly
the
Prussian
Army
had
an
uninspiring
reputation
and
was
counted
as
one
of
the
many
minor
armies
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
This
reputation
misrepresented
the
fact
of
a
standing
army
of
80
000
soldiers
representing
4
of
the
2
2
million
population
of
Prussia
17
Thus
the
Prussian
Army
was
disproportionate
to
the
size
of
the
state
it
protected
By
comparison
the
Austrian
Empire
had
16
million
citizens
but
had
an
army
only
half
its
authorised
size
because
of
financial
restraints
Thus
in
defending
the
vast
territory
of
the
Austrian
Empire
this
small
army
was
more
of
a
sieve
18
than
a
shield
against
foreign
invasion
Lands
of
the
Bohemian
Crown
until
1742
when
most
of
Silesia
was
ceded
to
Prussia
Moreover
the
Prussian
army
was
better
trained
than
other
armies
in
Europe
and
was
led
by
an
excellent
officer
corps
King
Frederick
William
I
and
the
guiding
genius
of
the
Prussian
Army
19
Leopold
I
Prince
of
Anhalt
Dessau
or
Old
Dessauer
had
drilled
the
Prussian
Army
to
a
perfection
previously
unknown
in
Europe
The
Prussian
infantry
soldier
was
so
well
trained
and
well
equipped
that
he
could
fire
5
shots
a
minute
to
an
Austrian
s
3
shots
per
minute
and
while
Prussian
cavalry
and
artillery
were
comparatively
less
efficient
they
were
still
of
better
quality
than
average
Furthermore
while
the
Austrians
had
to
wait
for
conscription
to
complete
the
field
forces
Prussian
regiments
took
the
field
at
once
With
this
army
it
might
not
have
been
surprising
that
Frederick
was
able
to
overrun
Silesia
However
Frederick
sought
even
more
advantages
in
the
war
he
was
planning
Accordingly
he
had
his
Foreign
Minister
Heinrich
von
Podewils
secretly
negotiate
a
treaty
with
France
to
put
Austria
in
a
two
front
war
In
this
way
Prussia
could
attack
the
Austrians
in
the
east
while
France
would
attack
Austria
from
the
west
A
treaty
with
France
was
signed
in
April
1739
20
In
early
December
Frederick
assembled
his
army
along
the
Oder
river
and
on
16th
December
without
a
formal
declaration
of
war
the
Prussians
invaded
Silesia
For
most
of
the
previous
century
Austria
s
military
resources
had
been
concentrated
in
Hungary
and
Italy
countering
threats
from
the
Ottomans
and
Spanish
respectively
while
neglecting
less
vulnerable
areas
As
a
result
the
Austrians
had
less
than
3
000
troops
available
to
defend
Silesia
and
although
this
was
increased
to
7
000
shortly
before
the
Prussian
attack
they
could
only
hold
the
fortresses
of
Glogau
Breslau
and
Brieg
abandoning
the
rest
of
the
province
and
retreating
into
Moravia
at
which
point
both
sides
went
into
winter
quarters
21
Prussia
now
controlled
most
of
the
single
richest
province
in
the
Hapsburg
Empire
Silesian
taxes
provided
10
of
total
Imperial
income
with
a
population
of
over
one
million
the
major
commercial
centre
of
Breslau
and
large
mining
weaving
and
dyeing
industries
22
However
Frederick
had
hoped
to
avoid
a
long
war
by
rapidly
capturing
all
of
Silesia
presenting
Maria
Theresa
with
a
fait
accompli
in
exchange
for
which
Prussia
would
guarantee
the
Hapsburgs
other
German
territories
Austria
s
retention
of
its
fortresses
in
Southern
Silesia
and
the
failure
of
Prussian
diplomatic
efforts
to
persuade
powers
like
Britain
and
Russia
to
agree
meant
a
quick
victory
could
not
be
achieved
23

Frederick
II
of
Prussia
Early
in
the
year
a
new
Austrian
field
army
under
general
Wilhelm
Reinhard
von
Neipperg
relieved
Neisse
and
marched
on
Brieg
threatening
to
cut
the
Prussians
off
On
10
April
Frederick
s
army
caught
the
Austrians
on
the
snow
covered
fields
near
Mollwitz
24
This
was
the
first
time
that
Frederick
had
led
troops
into
battle
25
The
victory
that
Frederick
attained
at
the
Battle
of
Mollwitz
was
a
learning
experience
for
the
young
King
who
departed
from
the
field
just
before
his
troops
routed
the
Austrians
both
his
tactics
and
his
cavalry
were
rather
clumsy
and
victory
was
only
obtained
due
to
the
discipline
of
the
Prussian
infantry
and
their
veteran
commander
Field
Marshall
Kurt
von
Schwerin
26
Frederick
obtained
an
alliance
with
the
French
against
the
Austrians
signing
the
Treaty
of
Breslau
on
5
June
27
28
Accordingly
the
French
began
to
cross
the
Rhine
on
15
August
28
and
joined
the
Bavarian
Elector
s
forces
on
the
Danube
and
advanced
towards
Vienna
29
The
combined
forces
of
the
French
and
the
Bavarians
captured
the
Austrian
town
of
Linz
on
14
September
28
29
However
at
this
point
the
objective
was
suddenly
changed
and
after
many
countermarches
the
anti
Austrian
allies
advanced
in
three
widely
separated
corps
on
Prague
A
French
corps
moved
via
Amberg
and
Pilsen
The
Elector
marched
on
Budweis
and
the
Saxons
who
had
now
joined
the
allies
against
Austria
29
invaded
Bohemia
by
the
Elbe
valley
The
Austrians
could
at
first
offer
little
resistance
but
before
long
a
considerable
force
intervened
at
T
bor
between
the
Danube
and
the
allies
and
Austrian
troops
including
Neipperg
were
soon
transferred
from
Silesia
back
to
the
west
to
defend
the
Austrian
capital
Vienna
from
the
French
With
fewer
Austrian
troops
in
Silesia
Frederick
now
had
an
easier
time
The
remaining
fortresses
in
Silesia
were
taken
by
the
Prussians
27
Before
he
left
Silesia
Austrian
General
Neipperg
had
made
a
curious
agreement
with
Frederick
the
so
called
Klein
Schnellendorf
agreement
9
October
1741
By
this
agreement
the
fortress
at
Neisse
was
surrendered
after
a
mock
siege
and
the
Prussians
agreed
to
let
the
Austrians
leave
unmolested
releasing
Neipperg
s
army
for
service
elsewhere
30
At
the
same
time
the
Hungarians
moved
to
enthusiasm
by
the
personal
appeal
in
September
1741
of
Maria
Theresia
31
had
put
into
the
field
a
lev
e
en
masse
or
insurrection
which
furnished
the
regular
army
with
an
invaluable
force
of
60
000
more
light
troops
32
A
fresh
army
was
collected
under
Field
Marshal
Khevenh
ller
at
Vienna
and
the
Austrians
planned
an
offensive
winter
campaign
against
the
Franco
Bavarian
forces
in
Bohemia
and
the
small
Bavarian
army
that
remained
on
the
Danube
to
defend
the
electorate
Meanwhile
the
Saxon
born
Maurice
de
Saxe
and
a
small
French
force
stormed
Prague
on
26
November
1741
Francis
Stephen
husband
of
Maria
Theresa
who
commanded
the
Austrians
in
Bohemia
moved
too
slowly
to
save
the
fortress
The
Elector
of
Bavaria
who
now
styled
himself
Archduke
of
Austria
was
crowned
King
of
Bohemia
9
December
1741
and
elected
to
the
imperial
throne
as
Charles
VII
24
January
1742
but
no
active
measures
were
undertaken
In
Bohemia
the
month
of
December
was
occupied
in
mere
skirmishes
On
the
Danube
Khevenh
ller
the
best
general
in
the
Austrian
service
advanced
on
27
December
swiftly
drove
back
the
allies
shut
them
up
in
Linz
and
pressed
on
into
Bavaria
33
Munich
itself
surrendered
to
the
Austrians
on
the
coronation
day
of
Charles
VII
At
the
close
of
this
first
act
of
the
campaign
the
French
under
the
old
Marshal
de
Broglie
maintained
a
precarious
foothold
in
central
Bohemia
menaced
by
the
main
army
of
the
Austrians
and
Khevenh
ller
was
ranging
unopposed
in
Bavaria
Frederick
made
a
secret
truce
with
Austria
and
thus
lay
inactive
in
Silesia
Campaigns
of
1742
edit
Prince
Charles
Alexander
of
Lorraine
Frederick
had
hoped
by
the
truce
to
secure
Silesia
for
which
alone
he
was
fighting
although
allied
with
the
French
he
had
no
wish
to
see
them
become
the
dominant
power
in
Germany
through
the
destruction
of
Austria
For
their
part
the
French
had
aspirations
to
divide
most
of
the
Habsburg
territories
between
themselves
Prussia
Bavaria
and
Saxony
But
with
the
successes
of
Khevenh
ller
and
the
enthusiastic
insurrection
of
Hungary
Maria
Theresa
s
opposition
became
firmer
and
she
divulged
the
provisions
of
the
truce
to
compromise
Frederick
with
his
allies
The
war
recommenced
Frederick
had
not
rested
idle
on
his
laurels
In
the
uneventful
summer
campaign
of
1741
he
had
found
time
to
begin
the
reorganisation
of
his
cavalry
The
training
of
the
Prussian
cavalry
had
been
neglected
by
Frederick
s
father
King
Frederick
William
I
34
Probably
because
he
himself
was
an
infantryman
to
his
core
the
training
of
the
cavalry
had
also
been
overlooked
by
the
Old
Dessauer
who
was
the
true
genius
behind
the
Prussian
Army
34
Frederick
had
been
disappointed
by
the
performance
of
his
cavalry
at
the
Battle
of
Mollwitz
35
However
as
a
result
of
Frederick
s
training
of
the
cavalry
over
the
summer
of
1741
the
Prussian
cavalry
would
soon
acquit
themselves
much
better
in
the
coming
battles
of
the
First
Silesian
War
Before
long
the
cavalry
would
be
more
efficient
than
the
Prussian
infantry
The
Bavarian
Emperor
Charles
VII
whose
territories
were
overrun
by
the
Austrians
asked
him
to
create
a
diversion
by
invading
Moravia
In
December
1741
therefore
the
Prussian
general
field
marshal
Kurt
Christoph
Graf
von
Schwerin
crossed
the
border
and
captured
Olmutz
Glatz
also
was
invested
and
the
Prussian
army
was
concentrated
about
Olomouc
in
January
1742
A
combined
plan
of
operations
was
made
by
the
French
Saxons
and
Prussians
for
the
rescue
of
Linz
But
Linz
soon
fell
Broglie
on
the
Vltava
weakened
by
the
departure
of
the
Bavarians
to
oppose
Khevenh
ller
and
of
the
Saxons
to
join
forces
with
Frederick
was
in
no
condition
to
take
the
offensive
and
large
forces
under
Prince
Charles
of
Lorraine
lay
in
his
front
from
Budweis
to
Jihlava
Iglau
Frederick
s
march
was
made
towards
Iglau
in
the
first
place
Brno
was
invested
about
the
same
time
February
but
the
direction
of
the
march
was
changed
and
instead
of
moving
against
Prince
Charles
Frederick
pushed
on
southwards
by
Znojmo
and
Mikulov
The
extreme
outposts
of
the
Prussians
appeared
before
Vienna
But
Frederick
s
advance
was
a
mere
foray
and
Prince
Charles
leaving
a
screen
of
troops
in
front
of
Broglie
marched
to
cut
off
the
Prussians
from
Silesia
while
the
Hungarian
levies
poured
into
Upper
Silesia
by
the
Jablunkov
Pass
The
Saxons
discontented
and
demoralised
soon
marched
off
to
their
own
country
and
Frederick
with
his
Prussians
fell
back
by
Svitavy
and
Litomy
l
to
Kutn
Hora
in
Bohemia
where
he
was
in
touch
with
Broglie
on
the
one
hand
and
Glatz
having
now
surrendered
with
Silesia
on
the
other
No
defence
of
Olomouc
was
attempted
and
the
small
Prussian
corps
remaining
in
Moravia
fell
back
towards
Upper
Silesia
Prince
Charles
marched
past
Jihlava
and
Teutsch
Deutsch
Brod
on
Kutn
Hora
in
pursuit
of
Frederick
On
17
May
1742
Frederick
turned
around
and
faced
the
Austrian
forces
that
were
pursuing
him
36
He
fought
the
Austrians
in
what
has
become
known
as
the
Battle
of
Chotusitz
After
a
severe
struggle
Frederick
won
a
major
Prussian
victory
At
Chotusitz
it
was
Frederick
s
newly
reorganised
and
trained
cavalry
that
really
won
the
victory
37
and
compensated
for
their
previous
failings
The
cavalry
s
conduct
gave
an
earnest
prospect
of
its
future
glory
not
only
by
its
charges
on
the
battlefield
but
by
its
vigorous
pursuit
of
the
defeated
Austrians
Almost
at
the
same
time
the
Battle
of
Chotusitz
was
occurring
French
Field
Marshal
Fran
ois
Broglie
fell
upon
a
part
of
the
Austrians
left
on
the
Vltava
and
won
a
small
but
morally
and
politically
important
success
in
the
action
of
Sahay
near
Budweis
24
May
1742
Frederick
did
not
propose
another
combined
movement
Frederick
s
victory
at
Chotusitz
along
with
the
victory
of
Field
Marshal
Broglie
persuaded
Maria
Theresa
to
seek
peace
even
if
it
meant
ceding
away
Silesia
to
make
good
her
position
elsewhere
25
Accordingly
a
separate
peace
between
Prussia
and
Austria
was
signed
at
Breslau
on
11
June
1742
which
drew
the
First
Silesian
War
to
a
close
38
However
the
larger
War
of
the
Austrian
Succession
continued
Campaign
of
1743
edit
The
year
1743
opened
disastrously
for
the
forces
of
the
new
Holy
Roman
Emperor
Charles
VII
The
French
and
Bavarian
armies
were
not
working
well
together
and
Field
Marshal
Broglie
had
been
placed
in
command
of
the
allied
army
in
Bavaria
39
This
created
tension
between
Broglie
and
the
Bavarian
commanders
Broglie
openly
quarrelled
with
the
Bavarian
field
marshal
Friedrich
Heinrich
von
Seckendorff
No
connected
resistance
was
offered
to
the
converging
march
of
Prince
Charles
s
army
along
the
Danube
Khevenh
ller
from
Salzburg
towards
southern
Bavaria
and
Prince
Lobkowitz
from
Bohemia
towards
the
Naab
The
Bavarians
under
the
command
of
Count
Minuzzi
suffered
a
severe
reverse
at
the
town
of
Simbach
near
Braunau
on
9
May
1743
at
the
hands
of
Prince
Charles
of
Lorraine
40
George
II
of
Great
Britain
Now
an
Anglo
Allied
army
commanded
by
King
George
II
retreated
down
the
Main
River
to
the
village
of
Hanau
41
This
army
had
been
formed
on
the
lower
Rhine
upon
the
withdrawal
of
the
French
Westphalian
Army
under
the
command
of
Count
Maillebois
This
British
army
became
known
as
the
Pragmatic
Army
because
it
was
a
confederation
of
states
that
supported
the
Pragmatic
Sanction
of
1713
agreements
to
recognize
Maria
Theresa
as
sovereign
of
the
Habsburg
Empire
The
Pragmatic
Army
had
been
advancing
southward
up
the
Main
into
Neckar
country
prior
to
this
retreat
in
the
summer
of
1743
A
French
army
under
Marshal
Noailles
was
being
collected
on
the
middle
Rhine
to
deal
with
this
new
force
Marshal
Noailles
correctly
anticipated
that
given
the
problems
faced
by
the
Pragmatic
Army
George
II
would
take
the
entire
British
Pragmatic
Army
back
down
the
Main
42
Marshal
Noailles
made
plans
to
lay
a
trap
for
the
Pragmatic
Army
and
destroy
it
However
Marshal
Noailles
s
ally
Marshal
Broglie
was
now
in
full
retreat
Strong
places
of
Bavaria
were
surrendered
one
after
the
other
to
Prince
Charles
Marshal
Noailles
s
French
and
Bavarian
army
was
suddenly
outnumbered
by
the
Pragmatic
Army
35
000
soldiers
to
26
000
soldiers
43
Before
Marshal
Noailles
could
order
a
retreat
his
army
was
surprised
and
defeated
on
27
June
1743
by
King
George
at
Dettingen
44
King
Frederick
of
Prussia
was
terrified
by
the
defeat
at
Dettingen
45
Frederick
saw
that
he
now
faced
a
coalition
of
enemies
that
included
Austria
Britain
and
Russia
45
However
Frederick
soon
realised
that
the
coalition
against
him
was
not
as
strong
as
it
first
appeared
Neither
Austria
nor
the
British
knew
how
to
exploit
their
victory
at
Dettingen
45
Marshal
Noailles
was
driven
almost
to
the
Rhine
by
King
George
The
French
and
Bavarian
army
had
been
completely
outmanoeuvred
and
was
in
a
position
of
the
greatest
danger
between
Aschaffenburg
and
Hanau
in
the
defile
formed
by
the
Spessart
Hills
and
the
river
Main
Yet
the
British
Pragmatic
Army
did
not
quickly
follow
up
the
attack
Thus
Marshal
Noailles
had
time
to
block
the
outlet
and
had
posts
all
around
At
this
point
the
allied
troops
had
to
force
their
way
through
the
French
and
Bavarian
lines
Still
because
of
the
heavy
losses
inflicted
on
the
French
the
Battle
of
Dettingen
and
the
follow
up
is
justly
reckoned
as
a
notable
victory
of
Anglo
Austrian
Hanoverian
arms
The
coalition
against
Frederick
was
suddenly
weakened
when
the
St
Petersburg
court
discovered
a
plot
to
overthrow
Tsarina
Elisabeth
and
bring
back
the
child
Ivan
VI
as
Tsar
with
his
mother
Grand
Duchess
Anna
Leopoldovna
serving
as
regent
for
the
child
45
Matters
were
made
much
worse
for
the
allies
against
Frederick
when
an
Austrian
envoy
Antoniotto
Botta
Adorno
was
found
to
be
intimately
involved
in
the
plot
Indeed
the
plot
became
known
as
the
Botta
Conspiracy
46
The
Botta
attempted
coup
redounded
badly
not
only
against
Austria
but
also
against
the
Saxon
and
British
courts
45
Frederick
s
initial
indifference
to
a
treaty
with
Russia
now
changed
to
enthusiasm
in
the
light
of
the
fallout
from
the
Botta
Conspiracy
47
Marshal
Broglie
worn
out
by
age
and
exertions
was
soon
replaced
by
Marshal
Coigny
48
Both
Broglie
and
Noailles
were
now
on
the
strict
defensive
behind
the
Rhine
Not
a
single
French
soldier
remained
in
Germany
and
Prince
Charles
prepared
to
force
the
passage
of
the
Rhine
river
in
the
Breisgau
while
George
II
King
of
Britain
moved
forward
via
Mainz
to
co
operate
by
drawing
upon
himself
the
attention
of
both
the
French
marshals
The
Anglo
allied
army
took
Worms
but
after
several
unsuccessful
attempts
to
cross
the
Rhine
river
Prince
Charles
went
into
winter
quarters
The
king
followed
his
example
drawing
his
troops
to
the
north
to
deal
if
necessary
with
the
army
which
the
French
were
collecting
on
the
frontier
of
the
Southern
Netherlands
Austria
Britain
the
Dutch
Republic
and
Sardinia
were
now
allied
Saxony
changed
sides
and
the
entry
of
Sweden
had
offset
the
loss
of
Russia
to
the
allies
Thus
Sweden
and
Russia
neutralised
each
other
Peace
of
bo
August
1743
Frederick
was
still
quiescent
France
Spain
and
Bavaria
actively
continued
the
struggle
against
Maria
Theresa
While
the
Battle
of
Dettingen
and
Russian
Botta
plot
were
capturing
all
the
attention
during
the
summer
of
1743
negotiations
between
the
British
the
Austrians
and
Sardinians
were
proceeding
quietly
in
the
city
of
Worms
49
The
Austrians
were
desperately
afraid
that
Frederick
II
would
soon
be
invading
the
Austrian
domains
again
Thus
the
Austrians
sought
a
separate
peace
with
Sardinia
in
Italy
Under
the
terms
of
the
Treaty
of
Worms
which
was
signed
on
13
September
1743
the
Austrian
Habsburgs
surrendered
all
territory
in
Italy
located
west
of
the
Ticino
River
and
Lake
Maggiore
to
Sardinia
50
Additionally
some
lands
south
of
the
Po
River
were
also
given
to
Sardinia
51
In
exchange
Sardinia
renounced
its
claim
to
Milan
guaranteed
the
Pragmatic
Sanction
and
agreed
to
provide
40
000
troops
for
a
joint
Italian
army
to
fight
the
Bourbons
Campaign
of
1744

Pastel

With
1744
began
the
Second
Silesian
War
Frederick
of
Prussia
was
disquieted
by
the
universal
success
of
the
Austrians
and
their
alliance
with
Sardinia
Accordingly
he
secretly
concluded
another
fresh
alliance
with
Louis
XV
of
France
52
France
had
posed
hitherto
as
an
auxiliary
its
officers
in
Germany
had
worn
the
Bavarian
cockade
and
only
with
Britain
was
it
officially
at
war
France
now
declared
war
directly
upon
Austria
and
Sardinia
April
1744
At
this
point
France
also
planned
a
diversion
which
they
hope
would
cause
Britain
to
leave
the
war
A
French
army
was
assembled
at
Dunkirk
to
support
the
cause
of
Charles
Edward
Stuart
Bonnie
Prince
Charlie
in
an
invasion
of
Great
Britain
Prince
Charles
was
son
of
James
Francis
Edward
Stuart
Stuart
pretender
to
the
British
throne
who
was
the
son
of
James
II
the
last
Catholic
and
last
Stuart
king
of
England
James
II
had
been
deposed
as
the
King
of
England
in
1688
in
favour
of
his
daughter
Mary
and
her
husband
the
Protestant
Prince
of
Orange
William
III
of
the
house
of
Orange
Nassau
There
remained
a
significant
element
of
the
population
of
the
British
Isles
that
hoped
for
the
return
of
the
Stuart
family
as
monarchs
King
Louis
XIV
of
France
had
shown
great
support
for
Stuart
cause
Indeed
in
1715
France
had
sponsored
an
uprising
in
Scotland
which
the
pretender
James
had
joined
but
it
was
defeated
Forbidden
to
return
to
France
by
the
new
king
Louis
XV
James
sought
sanctuary
elsewhere
Finally
Pope
Clement
XI
offered
James
and
his
family
the
use
of
Palazzo
Muti
and
a
lifetime
annuity
of
8
000
Roman
scudi
It
was
here
in
the
Palazzo
Muti
that
Charles
Edward
Stuart
was
born
and
had
lived
his
whole
life
Charles
had
much
more
charisma
than
his
father
and
now
Louis
XV
was
favourably
disposed
toward
helping
him
create
another
uprising
in
Scotland
Louis
XV
sent
Drummond
of
Balhaldy
as
an
emissary
to
the
Stuart
court
in
Rome
53
French
plans
called
for
Charles
to
be
in
Dunkirk
France
to
assemble
with
the
fleet
on
10
January
1744
yet
Balhaldy
had
only
arrived
in
Rome
on
19
December
1743
54
Thus
there
was
very
little
time
to
waste
On
23
December
1743
Charles
father
named
him
Prince
Regent
so
that
Charles
could
act
in
his
own
name
In
the
spring
of
1744
Prince
Charles
secretly
arrived
in
France
and
was
about
to
board
the
ships
that
would
take
him
to
England
However
on
the
night
before
he
was
to
board
a
fierce
storm
blew
up
this
storm
became
known
as
the
Protestant
Wind
and
wrecked
or
dispersed
the
entire
fleet
55
The
violent
storms
had
wrecked
the
crossing
attempt
and
the
planned
invasion
was
abandoned
However
Charles
did
not
give
up
hope
of
restoring
the
Stuart
family
to
the
throne
of
England
During
naval
operations
that
were
possible
preparations
for
the
return
of
Charles
Edward
Stuart
to
England
and
a
coordinated
French
invasion
of
England
there
occurred
on
22
February
1744
the
largest
sea
battle
of
the
war
56
This
naval
battle
took
place
in
the
Mediterranean
off
the
coast
of
Toulon
France
A
large
British
fleet
under
the
command
of
Admiral
Thomas
Mathews
with
Rear
Admiral
Richard
Lestock
second
in
command
was
blockading
the
French
coast
A
smaller
French
and
Spanish
naval
force
attacked
the
British
blockade
and
damaged
some
of
the
British
ships
forcing
the
British
to
withdraw
and
seek
repairs
Thus
the
British
blockade
of
the
French
coast
was
relieved
and
the
Spanish
fleet
apparently
controlled
the
Mediterranean
Sea
A
Spanish
squadron
took
refuge
in
the
harbour
at
Toulon
The
British
fleet
watched
this
squadron
carefully
from
a
harbour
a
short
distance
to
the
east
On
21
February
1744
the
Spanish
ships
put
to
sea
with
a
French
fleet
Admiral
Mathews
took
his
British
fleet
and
attacked
the
Spanish
fleet
from
22
February
until
23
February
1744
in
what
has
become
known
as
the
Battle
of
Toulon
However
because
of
mis
communication
and
possibly
treachery
on
the
part
of
Rear
Admiral
Lestock
the
smaller
Spanish
fleet
was
allowed
to
escape
With
the
knowledge
that
a
larger
French
fleet
was
sailing
to
the
rescue
the
British
ships
broke
off
combat
and
retreated
to
the
northeast
Although
technically
the
Battle
of
Toulon
was
regarded
as
a
victory
for
Britain
57
in
Britain
it
was
feared
by
the
public
that
the
combined
French
and
Spanish
ships
were
making
for
the
Straits
of
Gibraltar
and
for
a
gathering
of
ships
at
Brest
for
a
planned
invasion
of
England
58
As
a
consequence
bitter
recriminations
were
brought
against
Admiral
Mathews
for
letting
this
Spanish
French
fleet
get
away
and
subsequently
placing
England
in
danger
of
invasion
Consequently
both
Mathews
and
Lestock
were
tried
in
naval
court
Lestock
was
acquitted
unjustly
according
to
some
while
Mathews
was
found
guilty
also
regarded
as
an
injustice
by
some
commentators

on

Louis

in

000
men
invaded
the
Austrian
Netherlands
59

in

60
His

although
shorn

still
consisted
the

allied
army
previously
commanded
by
King
George
II
and
composed
of
British
Dutch
German
Hanoverian
and
Austrian
troops
The
French
put
four
armies
into
the
field
61
On
the
Rhine

000
troops
up
against
70
000
allied
troops
under

command
of
Prince

62
A
fresh
army
of
over
30
000
soldiers
under
the
Prince
de
Conti
was
located
between
the
Meuse
and
Moselle
Rivers
which
would
later
assist
the
Spaniards
in
Piedmont
and
Lombardy
61
This
plan
was
however
at
once
dislocated
by
the
advance
of
Prince
Charles
who
assisted
by
the
veteran
Marshal
Traun
skillfully
manoeuvred
his
allied
army
over
the
Rhine
near
Philippsburg
on
1
July
1744
and
captured
the
lines
of
Weissenburg
and
cut

army
from
Alsace
63
A
third
French
Army
composed
of
17
000
men
under
the
command
of
Duke
d
Harcourt
kept
Luxembourg
at
bay
61
Meanwhile
the
fourth
French
army
was
the
largest
army
that
put
to
field
in
the
summer
of
1744
This
was
the
Army
of
Flanders
Numbering
87
000
men
and
was
officially
under
the
command
of
the
king
of
France
Louis
XV
but
in
actuality
Louis
XV
was
being
militarily
advised
by
Marshal
Noailles
64
As
these
French
forces
invaded
the
Austrian
Netherlands
they
outnumbered
the
allied
armies
by
about
a
four
to
three
ratio
65
Furthermore
as
they
marched
into
the
Austrian
Netherlands
they
met
a
confused
resistance
offered
by
Dutch
forces
66
Consequently
the
French
Army
of
Flanders
made
rapid
progress
across
the
Austrian
Netherlands
65
The
situation
became
so
desperate
for
the
Dutch
that
the
Dutch
government
sent
an
envoy
to
the
king
of
France
to
seek
peace
This
plea
for
peace
was
rejected
by
the
French
65
However
the
situation
in
the
Austrian
Netherlands
was
changed
abruptly
by
the
successful
crossing
of
the
Rhine
on
30
June
1744
by
Prince
Charles
and
his
70
000
man
allied
army
65
Marshal
Coigny
caught
far
in
advance
of
the
other
French
forces
cut
his
way
back
through
the
enemy
at
Weissenburg
and
withdrew
towards
Strasbourg
67
Louis
XV
now
abandoned
the
invasion
of
the
Southern
Netherlands
and
his
army
moved
down
to
take
a
decisive
part
in
the
war
in
Alsace
and
Lorraine
Military
camp
war
of
the
Austrian
succession
Finally
on
12
July
1744
Frederick
II
of
Prussia
received
confirmation
that
Prince
Charles
had
taken
his
army
beyond
the
Rhine
and
into
France
67
Thus
Frederick
knew
that
Prince
Charles
would
not
be
able
to
present
any
immediate
problem
to
him
in
the
east
Consequently
on
15
August
1744
Frederick
II
crossed
the
Austrian
frontier
into
Bohemia
By
late
August
all
80
000
of
his
troops
were
in
Bohemia
68
The
attention
and
resources
of
Austria
had
been
fully
occupied
for
some
time
on
a
renewal
of
the
war
in
Silesia
However
neither
Maria
Theresa
nor
her
advisers
had
expected
the
Prussians
to
march
as
quickly
as
they
did
32
Accordingly
Frederick
s
invasion
of
Bohemia
came
as
a
surprise
to
the
Austrian
court
and
Frederick
was
almost
unopposed
in
Bohemia
One
column
consisting
of
40
000
troops
under
Frederick
s
own
command
passed
through
Saxony
another
column
of
16
000
men
under
the
command
of
Young
Dessauer
passed
through
Lusatia
while
a
third
consisting
of
16
000
soldiers
under
Count
Schwerin
advanced
from
Silesia
69
The
destination
for
all
three
columns
was
Prague
The
objective
was
reached
on
2
September
The
city
was
surrounded
and
besieged
Six
days
later
the
Austrian
garrison
was
compelled
to
surrender
25
Scarcely
had
Prague
surrendered
to
Frederick
II
than
he
was
off
marching
southwards
leaving
5
000
soldiers
under
General
Baron
Gottfried
Emanual
von
Einsiedel
to
garrison
Prague
70
Three
days
after
the
fall
of
Prague
Frederick
marched
with
his
army
marching
southwards
and
seized
Tabor
Budweis
and
Frauenberg
71
Maria
Theresa
once
again
rose
to
the
emergency
a
new
insurrection
took
the
field
in
Hungary
and
a
corps
of
regulars
was
assembled
to
cover
Vienna
Meanwhile
Austrian
diplomats
won
over
Saxony
to
the
Austrian
side
72
Because
of
Frederick
s
successful
campaign
in
Bohemia
Prince
Charles
sought
to
withdraw
from
Alsace
and
cross
the
Rhine
once
again
and
strike
at
the
Prussians
At
this
point
the
French
had
an
excellent
chance
to
strike
at
Prince
Charles
while
he
was
in
a
vulnerable
position
crossing
the
Rhine
However
the
French
military
command
was
distracted
and
could
not
take
any
action
at
all
and
Prince
Charles
was
able
to
cross
the
Rhine
once
again
unmolested
by
the
French
The
French
had
been
unable
to
act
because
they
were
thrown
into
confusion
by
King
Louis
XV
suddenly
becoming
very
ill
with
smallpox
at
Metz
69
The
King
s
condition
was
so
severe
that
many
feared
for
his
life
Only
Count
Seckendorf
commander
of
the
Bavarians
pursued
Prince
Charles
No
move
was
made
by
the
French
and
Frederick
thus
found
himself
isolated
and
exposed
to
the
combined
attack
of
the
Austrians
and
Saxons
Count
Traun
summoned
from
the
Rhine
held
the
king
in
check
in
Bohemia
with
a
united
force
of
Austrians
and
Saxons
The
Hungarian
irregulars
also
inflicted
numerous
minor
reverses
on
the
Prussians
Finally
Prince
Charles
arrived
with
the
main
army
from
the
west
The
campaign
resembled
that
of
1742
the
Prussian
retreat
was
closely
watched
and
the
rearguard
pressed
hard
Prague
fell
and
Frederick
was
completely
outmanoeuvred
by
the
united
forces
of
Prince
Charles
and
Count
Traun
73
Frederick
was
forced
to
retreat
to
Silesia
with
heavy
losses
However
the
Austrians
gained
no
foothold
in
Silesia
itself
On
the
Rhine
Louis
XV
now
recovered
had
besieged
and
taken
Freiburg
74
after
which
the
forces
left
in
the
north
were
reinforced
and
besieged
the
strong
places
of
Southern
Netherlands
There
was
also
a
slight
war
of
manoeuvre
on
the
middle
Rhine
Campaign
of
1745

Attack
of
the
Prussian
Infantry
at
the
Battle
of
Hohenfriedberg
by
Carl
R
chling
The
year
1745
saw
three
of
the
greatest
battles
of
the
war
Hohenfriedberg
Kesselsdorf
and
Fontenoy
The
first
event
of
the
year
was
the
formation
of
the
Quadruple
Alliance
of
Britain
Austria
the
Dutch
Republic
and
Saxony
concluded
at
Warsaw
on
8
January
1745
by
the
Treaty
of
Warsaw
75
Twelve
days
later
on
20
January
1745
the
death
of
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
Charles
VII
submitted
the
imperial
title
to
a
new
election
74
Charles
VII
s
son
and
heir
Maximilian
III
in
Bavaria
was
not
even
considered
a
candidate
for
the
Imperial
throne
The
Bavarian
army
was
again
unfortunate
Caught
in
its
scattered
winter
quarters
action
of
Amberg
7
Jan
it
was
driven
from
point
to
point
by
a
maneuver
by
the
Austrian
army
under
the
joint
command
of
Count
Batthy
ny
Baron
Bernklau
and
Count
Browne
All
Bavarian
garrisons
fled
to
the
east
The
Bavarian
Army
under
the
command
of
Count
T
rring
was
divided
and
paralyzed
76
The
French
in
the
area
under
Count
S
gur
marched
to
save
the
day
Count
S
gur
s
force
out
numbered
the
Austrian
army
under
Count
Batthyany
yet
S
gur
and
the
French
army
were
defeated
at
the
Battle
of
Pfaffenhofen
76
The
young
elector
Maximilian
III
Joseph
had
to
abandon
Munich
once
more
The
Peace
of
F
ssen
followed
on
22
April
1745
by
which
Maximilian
III
secured
his
hereditary
states
on
condition
of
supporting
the
candidature
of
the
Grand
Duke
Francis
consort
of
Maria
Theresa
The
imperial
army
ceased
ipso
facto
to
exist
The
Battle
of
Fontenoy
between
the
French
and
the
British
by
Louis
Nicolas
van
Blarenberghe
Frederick
II
of
Prussia
was
again
isolated
No
help
was
to
be
expected
from
France
whose
efforts
this
year
were
centred
on
the
Flanders
campaign
Indeed
on
31
March
1745
before
Frederick
ever
took
the
field
in
the
spring
of
1745
Louis
XV
and
the
Marshal
of
France
Maurice
de
Saxe
commanding
an
army
of
95
000
men
the
largest
force
in
the
war
marched
down
the
Scheldt
River
valley
and
had
besieged
Tournay
77
Tournay
was
defended
by
a
Dutch
garrison
of
7
000
soldiers
78
In
May
1745
a
British
army
under
the
command
of
the
Duke
of
Cumberland
attempted
to
break
the
French
siege
and
relieve
Tournay
Maurice
who
had
just
recently
been
appointed
a
Marshal
in
the
French
army
had
very
good
intelligence
and
knew
the
road
that
Cumberland
was
using
to
attack
his
forces
besieging
forces
Thus
Maurice
could
select
the
battlefield
Maurice
chose
to
attack
the
British
allied
army
on
a
plain
on
the
east
side
of
the
Scheldt
River
about
two
miles
southeast
of
Tournay
near
the
town
of
Fontenoy
79
There
the
Battle
of
Fontenoy
was
fought
on
11
May
1745
Fighting
began
at
5
00
AM
with
a
French
artillery
barrage
of
the
British
Allied
forces
who
were
still
attempting
to
move
into
their
proper
positions
for
their
anticipated
attack
on
Tournay
By
noon
Cumberland
s
troops
had
ground
to
a
halt
and
discipline
had
begun
to
dissolve
The
British
Allied
army
sought
cover
in
a
retreat
80
It
was
a
victory
for
the
French
that
captured
the
attention
of
Europe
because
it
overturned
the
mystique
of
British
military
superiority
and
it
pointed
out
the
importance
of
artillery
81
On
20
June
1745
after
the
Battle
on
Fontenoy
the
fortress
of
Tournay
surrendered
to
the
French
82
Marshal
General
Maurice
de
Saxe
In
the
summer
of
1745
the
French
once
more
decided
to
take
up
Charles
Edward
Stuart
s
claim
to
the
British
throne
The
goal
was
to
start
a
revolt
in
Scotland
which
would
divert
British
attention
away
from
the
war
on
the
mainland
in
Europe
and
may
even
require
Britain
to
leave
the
war
altogether
On
23
July
1745
Charles
landed
on
the
island
of
Eriskay
in
the
Hebrides
north
west
of
the
mainland
of
Scotland
83
On
25
July
1745
Charles
set
sail
again
for
the
mainland
By
the
end
of
August
1745
they
had
landed
Charles
in
Scotland
and
he
had
started
issuing
calls
for
troops
loyal
to
the
Jacobite
cause
of
placing
him
on
the
throne
84
Already
Charles
had
collected
1
300
Scots
prepared
to
fight
in
his
Jacobite
army
84
Defence
of
the
Hanovarian
rule
of
King
George
II
in
Great
Britain
fell
to
General
Sir
John
Cope
a
veteran
of
the
Battle
of
Dettingen
On
31
August
1745
Cope
marched
north
with
about
2
000
British
government
soldiers
84
Charles
reached
Perth
on
18
September
1745
and
Edinburgh
surrendered
to
him
on
27
September
1745
85
When
Cope
brought
his
army
up
to
the
town
of
Prestonpans
Scotland
on
1
October
1745
he
chose
a
stubble
field
that
he
felt
was
well
protected
on
which
to
encamp
his
troops
However
it
was
not
as
safe
as
he
thought
and
at
sunrise
the
next
morning
2
October
1745
Charles
s
Scottish
troops
attacked
and
defeated
the
British
government
army
86
With
the
government
army
defeat
at
Prestonpans
it
appeared
that
all
Scotland
belonged
to
Charles
By
November
1745
his
army
consisted
of
5
000
infantry
men
and
300
cavalry
87
In
mid
November
1745
it
crossed
the
border
from
Scotland
and
invaded
England
As
the
Jacobite
army
moved
south
into
England
Charles
kept
assuring
his
troops
that
aid
and
reinforcements
from
English
Jacobites
would
be
arriving
at
any
time
This
aide
and
reinforcements
were
desperately
needed
as
the
Jacobites
were
badly
outnumbered
by
the
three
British
government
armies
already
in
the
field
88
Finally
on
6
December
1745
at
Derby
in
the
English
midlands
Charles
was
reluctantly
persuaded
by
his
senior
officers
to
turn
back
to
Scotland
89
Upon
hearing
about
the
turnabout
in
Derby
the
French
gave
up
on
their
plans
for
an
invasion
of
England
90
The
Jacobites
felt
they
could
more
securely
fight
the
Hanovarians
in
a
defensive
battle
on
Scottish
soil
rather
than
fighting
the
British
government
army
in
England
On
17
January
1746
at
the
Battle
of
Falkirk
Muir
8
000
Scots
the
largest
amount
of
troops
gathered
by
the
Jacobite
cause
during
the
uprising
defeated
7
000
of
British
troops
91
Ultimately
however
Charles
Stuart
and
his
uprising
were
defeated
on
27
April
1746
at
the
Battle
of
Culloden
92
The
manoeuvres
of
the
armies
of
both
sides
in
the
war
on
the
upper
Elbe
occupied
all
the
summer
Meanwhile
the
political
questions
of
the
imperial
election
and
of
an
understanding
between
Prussia
and
Britain
were
pending
The
chief
efforts
of
Austria
were
directed
towards
the
valleys
of
the
Main
and
of
Lahn
and
Frankfurt
where
the
French
and
Austrian
armies
manoeuvred
for
a
position
from
which
to
overawe
the
electoral
body
Austrian
Marshal
Traun
was
successful
and
as
a
result
Francis
the
husband
consort
of
Maria
Theresa
was
elected
Holy
Roman
Emperor
on
13
September
1745
Frederick
agreed
with
Britain
to
recognise
the
election
a
few
days
later
but
Maria
Theresa
would
not
conform
to
the
Treaty
of
Breslau
of
1741
by
which
she
had
been
forced
to
recognise
Frederick
s
annexation
of
Silesia
Maria
Theresa
now
tried
a
further
appeal
to
the
fortunes
of
war
to
get
Silesia
back
Saxony
joined
Austria
in
this
last
attempt
to
reconquer
Silesia
In
May
1745
The
main
Prussian
army
was
stationed
at
Frankenstein
This
army
consisted
of
59
000
soldiers
and
was
fitted
with
54
heavy
cannon
93
Frederick
learned
that
a
combined
Austrian
Saxon
army
of
about
70
000
troops
under
the
command
of
Prince
Charles
was
on
the
march
to
the
northeast
towards
Landeshut
To
meet
this
threat
to
Silesia
Frederick
II
marched
north
toward
Reichenbach
Before
he
reached
Reichenbach
Frederick
learned
that
Prince
Charles
was
crossing
the
mountains
from
the
west
to
the
east
side
and
that
Prince
Charles
planned
to
occupy
the
town
of
Hohenfriedberg
Accordingly
Frederick
encamped
his
army
at
Schweidwitz
and
waited
for
Prince
Charles
to
come
to
him
At
this
site
Frederick
laid
a
trap
for
the
superior
Austrian
Saxon
forces
Indeed
Frederick
was
operating
on
the
theory
that
to
catch
a
mouse
leave
the
trap
open
94
At
6
30
AM
on
4
June
1745
while
the
Austrian
Saxon
troops
were
still
recovering
from
their
long
march
the
trap
was
sprung
on
them
in
the
Battle
of
Hohenfriedberg
95
The
Austrian
Saxon
forces
were
no
match
for
Frederick
s
army
and
especially
his
cavalry
and
they
lost
half
their
artillery
and
almost
a
quarter
of
their
men
At
9
00
AM
Prince
Charles
ordered
a
full
retreat
back
toward
Reichenberg
A
new
advance
of
Prince
Charles
quickly
brought
on
the
Battle
of
Soor
on
30
September
1745
This
battle
was
fought
on
ground
destined
to
be
famous
in
the
war
of
1866
Frederick
commanded
an
army
that
at
this
time
numbered
only
20
000
soldiers
in
the
vicinity
of
Soor
He
was
facing
Prince
Charles
with
an
army
of
41
000
troops
96
At
first
in
a
position
of
great
peril
but
his
army
changed
front
in
the
face
of
the
advancing
enemy
and
by
its
boldness
and
tenacity
won
a
remarkable
victory
on
30
September
1745
at
Soor
But
the
campaign
was
not
ended
An
Austrian
contingent
from
the
Main
joined
the
Saxons
under
Field
Marshal
Rutowsky
1702
1764
and
a
combined
movement
was
made
in
the
direction
of
Berlin
by
Rutowsky
from
Saxony
and
Prince
Charles
from
Bohemia
The
danger
was
very
great
Frederick
hurried
up
his
forces
from
Silesia
and
marched
as
rapidly
as
possible
on
Dresden
in
Saxony
Frederick
won
the
actions
of
Katholisch
Hennersdorf
on
24
November
1745
and
G
rlitz
on
25
November
Prince
Charles
was
thereby
forced
to
abandon
his
plans
to
attack
Silesia
and
hurry
back
to
defend
Saxony
A
second
Prussian
army
under
the
Old
Dessauer
advanced
up
the
Elbe
from
Magdeburg
to
meet
Rutowsky
The
latter
took
up
a
strong
position
at
Kesselsdorf
between
Meissen
and
Dresden
but
the
veteran
Leopold
attacked
him
directly
and
without
hesitation
on
14
December
1745
The
Saxons
and
their
allies
were
completely
routed
after
a
hard
struggle
in
the
Battle
of
Kesselsdorf
Maria
Theresa
was
at
last
forced

In
central
Italy
an
army
of
Spaniards
and
Neapolitans
was
collected
for
the
purpose
of
conquering
the
Milanese
In
1741
the
allied
army
of
40
000
Spaniards
and
Neapolitans
under
the
command
of
the
Duke
of
Montmar
had
advanced
towards
Modena
the
Duke
of
Modena
had
allied
himself
with
them
but
the
vigilant
Austrian
commander
Count
Otto
Ferdinand
von
Traun
had
out
marched
them
captured
Modena
and
forced
the
Duke
to
make
a
separate
peace
The
aggressiveness
of
the
Spanish
in
Italy
forced
Empress
Maria
Theresa
of
Austria
and
King
Charles
Emmanuel
of
Sardinia
into
negotiations
in
early
1742
97
These
negotiations
were
held
at
Turin
Maria
Theresa
sent
her
envoy
Count
Schulenburg
and
King
Charles
Emmanuel
sent
the
Marquis
d
Ormea
On
1
February
1742
Schulenburg
and
Ormea
signed
the
Convention
of
Turin
which
resolved
or
postponed
resolution
many
differences
and
formed
an
alliance
between
the
two
countries

field
marshal
Count
Traun
held
his
own
with
ease
against
the
Spanish
and
Neapolitans
On
19
August
1742
Naples
was
forced
by
the
arrival
of
a
British
naval
squadron
in
Naple
s
own
harbour
to
withdraw
her
10
000
troops
from
the
Montemar
force
to
provide
for
home
defence
99
The
Spanish
force
under
Montemar
was
now
too
weak
to
advance
in
the
Po
Valley
and
a
second
Spanish
army
was
sent
to
Italy
via
France
Sardinia
had
allied
herself
with
Austria
in
the
Convention
of
Turin
and
at
the
same
time
neither
state
was
at
war
with
France
and
this
led
to
curious
complications
combats
being
fought
in
the
Is
re
valley
between
the
troops
of
Sardinia
and
of
Spain
in
which
the
French
took
no
part
At
the
end
of
1742
the
Duke
of
Montemar
was
replaced
as
head
of
the
Spanish
forces
in
Italy
by
Count
Gages
100
In
1743
the
Spanish
on
the
Panaro
had
achieved
a
victory
over
Traun
at
Campo
Santo
on
8
February
1743
101
However
the
next
six
months
were
wasted
in
inaction
and
Georg
Christian
F
rst
von
Lobkowitz
joining
Traun
with
reinforcements
from
Germany
drove
back
the
Spanish
to
Rimini
Observing
from
Venice
Rousseau
hailed
the
Spanish
retreat
as
the
finest
military
manoeuvre
of
the
whole
century
102
The
Spanish
Savoyan
War
in
the
Alps
continued
without
much
result
the
only
incident
of
note
being
the
first
Battle
of
Casteldelfino
7
10
October
1743
when
an
initial
French
offensive
was
beaten
off
In
1744
the
Italian
war
became
serious
Prior
to
the
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
1701
1714
Spain
and
Austria
had
been
ruled
by
the
same
Habsburg
royal
house
Consequently
the
foreign
policies
of
Austria
and
Spain
in
regards
to
Italy
had
a
symmetry
of
interests
and
these
interests
were
usually
opposed
to
the
interests
of
Bourbon
controlled
France
103
However
since
the
Treaty
of
Utrecht
and
the
end
of
the
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
the
childless
last
Habsburg
monarch
Charles
II
had
been
replaced
by
the
Bourbon
grandson
of
the
French
king
Louis
XIV
Philip
of
Anjou
who
became
Philip
V
in
Spain
Now
the
symmetry
of
foreign
policy
interests
in
regards
to
Italy
existed
between
Bourbon
France
and
Bourbon
Spain
with
Habsburg
Austria
usually
in
opposition
104
King
Charles
Emmanuel
of
Savoy
had
followed
the
long
established
foreign
policy
of
Savoy
of
opposing
Spanish
interference
in
northern
Italy
58
Now
in
1744
Savoy
was
faced
with
a
grandiose
military
plan
of
the
combined
Spanish
and
French
armies
called
the
Gallispan
army
for
conquest
of
northern
Italy
However
in
implementing
this
plan
the
Gallispan
generals
at
the
front
were
hampered
by
the
orders
of
their
respective
governments
For
example
the
commander
of
the
Spanish
army
in
the
field
the
Prince
of
Conti
could
not
get
along
with
or
even
reason
with
the
Marquis
de
La
Mina
the
Supreme
commander
of
all
Spanish
forces
105
The
Prince
of
Conti
felt
that
the
Marquis
deferred
blindly
to
all
orders
coming
from
Spain
without
any
consideration
of
the
realities
on
the
ground
105
In
preparation
for
the
military
campaign
the
Gallispan
forces
sought
to
cross
the
Alps
in
June
1744
and
regroup
the
army
in
Dauphin
uniting
there
with
the
army
on
the
lower
Po

The
support
of
Genoa
allowed
a
road
into
central
Italy
105
While
the
Prince
of
Conti
stayed
in
the
north
Count
Gages
followed
this
road
to
the
south
But
then
the
Austrian
commander
Prince
Lobkowitz
took
the
offensive
and
drove
the
Spanish
army
of
the
Count
de
Gages
further
southward
towards
the
Neapolitan
frontier
near
the
small
town
of
Velletri
Velletri
just
happened
to
be
the
birthplace
of
Caesar
Augustus
but
now
from
June
through
August
1744
Velletri
became
the
scene
of
extensive
military
maneuvering
between
the
French
Spanish
army
under
the
command
of
the
Count
Gages
and
the
Austrian
forces
under
the
command
of
Prince
Lobkowitz
107
The
King
of
Naples
the
future
Charles
III
of
Spain
was
increasingly
worried
about
the
Austrian
army
operating
so
close
to
his
borders
and
decided
to
assist
the
Spaniards
Together
a
combined
army
of
French
Spanish
and
Neapolitans
surprised
the
Austrian
army
on
the
night
of
16
17
June
1744
The
Austrians
were
routed
from
three
important
hills
around
the
town
of
Velletri
during
the
attack
108
This
battle
is
sometimes
called
the
Battle
of
Nemi
after
the
small
town
of
Nemi
located
nearby
Because
of
this
surprise
attack
the
combined
army
was
able
to
take
possession
of
the
town
of
Velletri
Thus
the
surprise
attack
has
also
been
called
the
first
Battle
of
Velletri
In
early
August
1744
the
King
of
Naples
paid
a
visit
in
person
to
the
newly
captured
town
of
Velletri
108
Hearing
about
the
presence
of
the
King
the
Austrians
developed
a
plan
for
a
daring
raid
on
Velletri
During
the
predawn
hours
of
11
August
1744
about
6
000
Austrians
under
the
direct
command
of
Count
Browne
staged
a
surprise
raid
on
the
town
of
Velletri
They
were
attempting
to
abduct
the
King
of
Naples
during
his
stay
in
the
town
However
after
occupying
Velletri
and
searching
the
entire
town
the
Austrians
found
no
hint
of
the
King
of
Naples
The
King
had
become
aware
of
what
was
happening
and
had
fled
through
a
window
of
the
palace
where
he
was
staying
and
rode
off
half
dressed
on
horseback
out
of
the
town
109
This
was
the
second
Battle
of
Velletri
The
failure
of
the
raid
on
Velletri
meant
that
the
Austrian
march
toward
Naples
was
over
The
defeated
Austrians
were
ordered
north
where
they
could
be
used
in
the
Piedmont
of
northern
Italy
to
assist
the
King
of
Sardinia
against
the
Prince
of
Conti
Count
de
Gages
followed
the
Austrians
north
with
a
weak
force
Meanwhile
the
King
of
Naples
returned
home
The
Prince
of
Conti
by
Alexis
Simon
Belle
The
war
in
the
Alps
and
the
Apennines
had
already
been
keenly
contested
before
the
Prince
of
Conti
and
the
Gallispan
army
had
come
down
out
of
the
Alps
Villefranche
and
Montalb
n
had
been
stormed
by
Conti
on
20
April
1744
After
coming
down
out
of
the
Alps
Prince
Conti
began
his
advance
into
Piedmont
on
5
July
1744
110
On
19
July
1744
the
Gallispan
army
engaged
the
Sardinian
army
in
some
desperate
fighting
at
Peyre
Longue
on
18
July
1744
111
As
a
result
of
the
battle
the
Gallispan
army
took
control
of
Casteldelfino
in
the
second
Battle
of
Casteldelfino
Conti
then
moved
on
to
Delmonte
where
on
the
night
of
8
9
August
1744
a
mere
36
hours
before
the
Spanish
army
in
south
of
Italy
fought
the
second
Battle
of
Velletri
as
noted
above
the
Gallispan
army
took
the
city
of
Delmonte
from
the
Sardinians
in
the
Battle
of
Delmonte
112
The
King
of
Sardinia
was
defeated
yet
again
by
Conti
in
a
great
Battle
at
Madonna
dell
Olmo
on
30
September
1744
near
Coni
Cuneo
113
Conti
did
not
however
succeed
in
taking
the
huge
fortress
at
Coni
and
had
to
retire
into
Dauphin
for
his
winter
quarters
Thus
the
Gallispan
army
never
did
combine
with
the
Spanish
army
under
Count
of
Gages
in
the
south
and
now
the
Austro
Sardinian
army
lay
between
them
The
campaign
in
Italy
in
1745
was
also
no
mere
war
of
posts
The
Convention
of
Turin
of
February
1742
described
above
which
established
a
provisional
relationship
between
Austria
and
Sardinia
had
caused
some
consternation
in
the
Republic
of
Genoa
However
when
this
provisional
relationship
was
given
a
more
durable
and
reliable
character
in
the
signing
of
the
Treaty
of
Worms
1743
signed
on
13
September
1743
114
the
government
of
Genoa
became
fearful
This
fear
of
diplomatic
isolation
had
caused
the
Genoese
Republic
to
abandon
its
neutrality
in
the
war
and
join
the
Bourbon
cause
115
Consequently
the
Genoese
Republic
signed
a
secret
treaty
with
the
Bourbon
allies
of
France
Spain
and
Naples
On
26
June
1745
Genoa
declared
war
on
Sardinia
115
Empress
Maria
Theresa
was
frustrated
with
the
failure
of
Lobkowitz
to
stop
the
advance
of
Gage
Accordingly
Lobkowitz
was
replaced
with
Count
Schulenburg
116
A
change
in
the
command
of
the
Austrians
encouraged
the
Bourbon
allies
to
strike
first
in
the
spring
of
1745
Accordingly
Count
de
Gages
moved
from
Modena
towards
Lucca
the
Gallispan
army
in
the
Alps
under
the
new
command
of
Marshal
Maillebois
Prince
Conti
and
Marshal
Maillebois
had
exchanged
commands
over
the
winter
of
1744
1745
117
advanced
through
the
Italian
Riviera
to
the
Tanaro
In
the
middle
of
July
1745
the
two
armies
were
at
last
concentrated
between
the
Scrivia
and
the
Tanaro
Together
Count
de
Gage
s
army
and
the
Gallispan
army
composed
an
unusually
large
number
of
80
000
men
A
swift
march
on
Piacenza
drew
the
Austrian
commander
thither
and
in
his
absence
the
allies
fell
upon
and
completely
defeated
the
Sardinians
at
Bassignano
on
27
September
1745
a
victory
which
was
quickly
followed
by
the
capture
of
Alessandria
Valenza
and
Casale
Monferrato

of
forces
which
effected
the
victory

The
complicated
politics
of
Italy
however
are
reflected
in
the
fact
that
Count
Maillebois
was
ultimately
unable
to
turn
his
victory
to
account
Indeed
early
in
1746
Austrian
troops
freed
by
the
Austrian
peace
with
Frederick
II
of
Prussia
passed
through
the
Tyrol
into
Italy
The
Gallispan
winter
quarters
at
Asti
Italy
were
brusquely
attacked
and
a
French
garrison
of
6
000
men
at
Asti
was
forced
to
capitulate
118
At
the
same
time
Maximilian
Ulysses
Count
Browne
with
an
Austrian
corps
struck
at
the
allies
on
the
Lower
Po
and
cut
off
their
communication
with
the
main
body
of
the
Gallispan
army
in
Piedmont
A
series
of
minor
actions
thus
completely
destroyed
the
great
concentration
of
Gallispan
troops
and
the
Austrians
reconquered
the
duchy
of
Milan
and
took
possession
of
much
of
northern
Italy
The
allies
separated
Maillebois
covering
Liguria
the
Spaniards
marching
against
Browne
The
latter
was
promptly
and
heavily
reinforced
and
all
that
the
Spaniards
could
do
was
to
entrench
themselves
at
Piacenza
Philip
the
Spanish
Infante
as
supreme
commander
calling
up
Maillebois
to
his
aid
The
French
skilfully
conducted
and
marching
rapidly
joined
forces
once
more
but
their
situation
was
critical
for
only
two
marches
behind
them
the
army
of
the
King
of
Sardinia
was
in
pursuit
and
before
them
lay
the
principal
army
of
the
Austrians
The
pitched
Battle
of
Piacenza
on
16
June
1746
was
hard
fought
but
ended
in
an
Austrian
victory
with
the
Spanish
army
heavily
mauled
That
the
army
escaped
at
all
was
in
the
highest
degree
creditable
to
Maillebois
and
to
his
son
and
chief
of
staff
Under
their
leadership
the
Gallispan
army
eluded
both
the
Austrians
and
the
Sardinians
and
defeated
an
Austrian
corps
in
the
Battle
of
Rottofreddo
on
12
August
1746
119
Then
the
Austrian
army
made
good
its
retreat
back
to
Genoa
Although
the
Austrian
army
was
a
mere
shadow
of
its
former
self
when
they
returned
to
Genoa
the
Austrians
were
soon
in
control
of
northern
Italy
The
Austrians
occupied
the
Republic
of
Genoa
on
6
September
1746
120
But
they
met
with
no
success
in
their
forays
towards
the
Alps
Soon
Genoa
revolted
from
the
oppressive
rule
of
the
victors
rose
and
drove
out
the
Austrians
on
5
11
December
1746
As

Allied
invasion

and
the
French
now
commanded

out
against
a

Austrian
siege
122
As
usual
the
plan
of
campaign
had
been
referred
to
Paris
and
Madrid
A
picked
corps
of
the
French
army
under
the
Chevalier
de
Belle
Isle
the
younger
brother
of
Marshal
Belle
Isle
123
was
ordered
to
storm
the
fortified
pass
of
Exilles
on
10
July
1747
However
the
defending
army
of
the
Worms
allies
Austria
and
Savoy
handed
the
French
army
a
crushing
defeat
at
this
battle
which
became
known
as
the
Colle
dell
Assietta
124
At
this
battle
the
chevalier
and
with
him
much
of
the
elite
of
the
French
nobility
were
killed
on
the
barricades

Conclusion
of
the
war
edit
Europe
in
the
years
after
the
Treaty
of
Aix
la
Chapelle
in
1748
The
War
of
Austrian
Succession
concluded
with
the
Treaty
of
Aix
la
Chapelle
1748
Maria
Theresa
and
Austria
survived
nearly
status
quo
ante
bellum
sacrificing
only
the
territory
of
Silesia
which
Austria
conceded
to
Prussia
and
a
few
minor
territorial
losses
to
Spain
in
northern
Italy
The
loss
of
Silesia
was
in
great
measure
a
humiliating
defeat
for
Austria
s
leadership
of
the
German
states
within
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
This
marked
the
beginning
of
the
German
dualism
between
Prussia
and
Austria
which
would
ultimately
fuel
German
nationalism
and
the
drive
to
unify
Germany
as
a
single
entity

Despite
his
victories
Louis
XV
of
France
who
wanted
to
appear
as
an
arbiter
and
statesman
and
not
as
a
conqueror
gave
all
of
his
conquests
back
to
his
defeated
enemies
with
honour
arguing
that
he
was
King
of
France
not
a
merchant
125
This
decision
largely
misunderstood
by
his
generals
and
by
the
French
people
made
the
king
unpopular
at
home
The
French
obtained
so
little
of
what
they
had
fought
for
that
they
adopted
the
expressions
B
te
comme
la
paix
Stupid
as
the
peace
and
Travailler

de
Prusse
To
work

the
king
of
Prussia
i
e
working

France
definitely
succeeded
in
humiliating
Maria
Theresa
and
her
kingdom
But
because
of
this
France
had
bolstered
Prussia
s
power
which
was
to
continue
to
grow
to
France
s
later
detriment
Twice
during
the
war
Prussia
had
made
peace
with
Austria
without
informing
France
leading
Louis
XV
to
consider
Frederick
II
of
Prussia
whom
he
already
greatly
disliked
an
untrustworthy
ally
Despite
the
long
history
of
conflict
between
the
Houses
of
Habsburg
and
Bourbon
he
began
to
make
overtures
of
alliance
to
Austria
instead
Spain
in
one
way
or
another
managed
to
achieve
some
of
her
war
aims
which
mostly
centred
on
an
effort
to
reinstate
Spanish
influence
in
the
Italian
peninsula
Britain
managed
to
get
out
of
the
war
with
a
favorable
settlement
and
on
its
own
terms
which
angered
the
Austrians
Britain
s
power
was
increasing
and
its
interests
becoming
even
more
complex
Realizing
that
Austria
was
no
longer
the
sole
hegemon
of
Central
Europe
Britain
decided
to
align
itself
with
Prussia
in
order
to
protect
Hanover
from
future
French
attack
This
alliance
however
ended
up
destabilizing
the
continent
as
the
other
great
powers
braced
themselves
with
a
counter
grand
alliance
for
an
upcoming
war
that
proved
to
be
even
grander
in
scale
General

edit
The
triumph
of
Prussia
was
in
a
great
measure
due
to
its
fuller
application
of
principles
of
tactics
and
discipline
universally
recognised
though
less
universally
enforced
The
other
powers
reorganised
their
forces
after
the
war
not
so
much
on
the
Prussian
model
as
on
the
basis
of
a
stricter
application
of
known
general
principles
Prussia
moreover
was
far
ahead
of
all
the
other
continental
powers
in
administration
and
over
Austria
in
particular
its
advantage
in
this
matter
was
almost
decisive
Added
to
this
was
the
personal
ascendancy
of
Frederick
as
opposed
to
generals
who
were
responsible
for
their
men
to
their
individual
sovereigns

The
war
like
other
conflicts
of
the
time
featured
an
extraordinary
disparity
between
the
end
and
the
means
The
political
schemes
to
be
executed
by
the
French
and
other
armies
were
as
grandiose
as
any
of
modern
times
Their
execution
under
the
conditions
of
time
and
space
invariably
fell
short
of
expectations
and
the
history
of
the
war
proves
as
that
of
the
Seven
Years
War
was
to
prove
that
the
small
standing
army
of
the
18th
century
could
conquer
by
degrees
but
could
not
deliver
a
decisive
blow
Frederick
alone
with
a
definite
end
and
proportionate
means
to
achieve
it
succeeded
Less
was
to
be
expected
when
the
armies
were
composed
of
allied
contingents
sent
to
the
war
each
for
a
different
object
The
allied
national
armies
of
1813
at
the
Battle
of
Leipzig
co
operated
loyally
for
they
had
much
at
stake
and
worked
for
a
common
object
Those
of
1741
represented
the
divergent
private
interests
of
the
several
dynasties
and
achieved
nothing

the

in

and
did
not

until
after

declarations
of

The
frontiers
between

were
the
site
of
frequent

and

against

targets
although
several
attempts
were

Carnatic
Wars
Flag
of
the
East
India
Company
founded
in
1600
The
war
marked
the
beginning
of
great
power
in
England
and
the
powerful
struggle
between
Britain
and
France
in
India
and
of
European
military
ascendancy
and
political
intervention
in
the
subcontinent
Major
hostilities
began
with
the
arrival
of
a
naval
squadron
under
Mah
de
la
Bourdonnais
carrying
troops
from
France
In
September
1746
Bourdonnais
landed
his
troops
near
Madras
and
laid
siege
to
the
port
Although
it
was
the
main
British
settlement
in
the
Carnatic
Madras
was
weakly
fortified
and
had
only
a
small
garrison
reflecting
the
thoroughly
commercial
nature
of
the
European
presence
in
India
hitherto
On
10
September
only
six
days
after
the
arrival
of
the
French
force
Madras
surrendered
The
terms
of
the
surrender
agreed
by
Bourdonnais
provided
for
the
settlement
to
be
ransomed
back
for
a
cash
payment
by
the
British
East
India
Company
However
this
concession
was
opposed
by
Dupleix
the
governor
general
of
the
Indian
possessions
of
the
Compagnie
des
Indes
When
Bourdonnais
was
forced
to
leave
India
in
October
after
the
devastation
of
his
squadron
by
a
cyclone
Dupleix
reneged
on
the
agreement
The
Nawab
of
the
Carnatic
Anwaruddin
Muhammed
Khan
intervened
in
support
of
the
British
and
advanced
to
retake
Madras
but
despite
vast
superiority
in
numbers
his
army
was
easily
and
bloodily
crushed
by
the
French
in
the
first
demonstration
of
the
gap
in
quality
that
had
opened
up
between
European
and
Indian
armies
British
Admiral
Edward
Boscawen
besieged
Pondicherry
in
the
later
months
of
1748
The
French
now
turned
to
the
remaining
British
settlement
in
the
Carnatic
Fort
St
David
at
Cuddalore
which
was
dangerously
close
to
the
main
French
settlement
of
Pondich
ry
The
first
French
force
sent
against
Cuddalore
was
surprised
and
defeated
nearby
by
the
forces
of
the
Nawab
and
the
British
garrison
in
December
1746
Early
in
1747
a
second
expedition
laid
siege
to
Fort
St
David
but
withdrew
on
the
arrival
of
a
British
naval
squadron
in
March
A
final
attempt
in
June
1748
avoided
the
fort
and
attacked
the
weakly
fortified
town
of
Cuddalore
itself
but
was
routed
by
the
British
garrison
With
the
arrival
of
a
naval
squadron
under
Admiral
Boscawen
carrying
troops
and
artillery
the
British
went
on
the
offensive
laying
siege
to
Pondich
ry
They
enjoyed
a
considerable
superiority
in
numbers
over
the
defenders
but
the
settlement
had
been
heavily
fortified
by
Dupleix
and
after
two
months
the
siege
was
abandoned
The
peace
settlement
brought
the
return
of
Madras
to
the
British
company
exchanged
for
Louisbourg
in
Canada
However
the
conflict
between
the
two
companies
continued
by
proxy
during
the
interval
before
the
outbreak
of
the
Seven
Years
War
with
British
and
French
forces
fighting
on
behalf
of
rival
claimants
to
the
thrones
of
Hyderabad
and
the
Carnatic
Naval
operations
edit
The
naval
operations
of
this
war
were
entangled
with
the
War
of
Jenkins
Ear
which
broke
out
in
1739
in
consequence
of
the
long
disputes
between
Britain
and
Spain
over
their
conflicting
claims
in
America
The
war
was
remarkable
for
the
prominence
of
privateering
on
both
sides
It
was
carried
on
by
the
Spaniards
in
the
West
Indies
with
great
success
and
actively
at
home
The
French
were
no
less
active
in
all
seas
Mah
de
la
Bourdonnais
s
attack
on
Madras
partook
largely
of
the
nature
of
a
privateering
venture
The
British
retaliated
with
vigour
The
total
number
of
captures
by
French
and
Spanish
corsairs
was
in
all
probability
larger
than
the
list
of
British
as
the
French
wit
Voltaire
drolly
put
it
upon
hearing
his
government
s
boast
namely
that
more
British
merchants
were
taken
because
there
were
many
more
British
merchant
ships
to
take
but
partly
also
because
the
British
government
had
not
yet
begun
to
enforce
the
use
of
convoy
so
strictly
as
it
did
in
later
times

Vice

Edward

War
on
Spain
was
declared
by
Great
Britain
on
23
October
1739
which
has
become
known
as
the
War
of
Jenkins
Ear
A
plan
was
laid
for
combined
operations
against
the
Spanish
colonies
from
east
and
west
One
force
military
and
naval
was
to
assault
them
from
the
West
Indies
under
Admiral
Edward
Vernon
Another
to
be
commanded
by
Commodore
George
Anson
afterwards
Lord
Anson
was
to
round
Cape
Horn
and
to
fall
upon
the
Pacific
coast
of
Latin
America
Delays
bad
preparations
dockyard
corruption
and
the
squabbles
of
the
naval
and
military
officers
concerned
caused
the
failure
of
a
hopeful
scheme
On
21
November
1739
Admiral
Vernon
did
however
succeed
in
capturing
the
ill
defended
Spanish
harbour
of
Porto
Bello
in
present
day
Panama
When
Vernon
had
been
joined
by
Sir
Chaloner
Ogle
with
massive
naval
reinforcements
and
a
strong
body
of
troops
an
attack
was
made
on
Cartagena
in
what
is
now
Colombia
9
March
24
April
1741
The
delay
had
given
the
Spanish
under
Sebasti
n
de
Eslava
and
Blas
de
Lezo
time
to
prepare
After
two
months
of
skilful
defence
by
the
Spanish
the
British
attack
finally
succumbed
to
a
massive
outbreak
of
disease
and
withdrew
having
suffered
a
dreadful
loss
of
lives
and
ships
The
war
in
the
West
Indies
after
two
other
unsuccessful
attacks
had
been
made
on
Spanish
territory
died
down
and
did
not
revive
until
1748
The
expedition
under
Anson
sailed
late
was
very
ill
provided
and
less
strong
than
had
been
intended
It
consisted
of
six
ships
and
left
Britain
on
18
September
1740
Anson
returned
alone
with
his
flagship
the
Centurion
on
15
June
1744
The
other
vessels
had
either
failed
to
round
the
Horn
or
had
been
lost
But
Anson
had
harried
the
coast
of
Chile
and
Peru
and
had
captured
a
Spanish
galleon
of
immense
value
near
the
Philippines
His
cruise
was
a
great
feat
of
resolution
and
endurance
After
the
failure
of
the
British
invasions
and
a
Spanish
counter
invasion
of
Georgia
in
1742
belligerent
naval
actions
in
the
Caribbean
were
left
to
the
privateers
of
both
sides
Fearing
great
financial
and
economic
losses
should
a
treasure
fleet
be
captured
the
Spanish
reduced
the
risk
by
increasing
the
number
of
convoys
thereby
reducing
their
value
They
also
increased
the
number
of
ports
they
visited
and
reduced
the
predictability
of
their
voyages
In
1744
300
British
militia
slaves
and
regulars
with
two
privateers
from
Saint
Kitts
invaded
the
French
half
of
neighbouring
Saint
Martin
holding
it
until
the
1748
Treaty
of
Aix
la
Chapelle
In
late
May
1745
two
French
royal
frigates
of
36
and
30
guns
respectively
under
Commodore
La
Touch
plus
three
privateers
in
retaliation
sailed
from
Martinique
to
invade
and
capture
Anguilla
but
were
repelled
with
heavy
loss
The
last
year
of
the
war
saw
two
significant
actions
in
the
Caribbean
A
second
British
assault
on
Santiago
de
Cuba
which
also
ended
in
failure
and
a
naval
action
which
arose
from
an
accidental
encounter
between
two
convoys
The
action
unfolded
in
a
confused
way
with
each
side
at
once
anxious
to
cover
its
own
trade
and
to
intercept
that
of
the
other
Capture
was
rendered
particularly
desirable
for
the
British
by
the
fact
that
the
Spanish
homeward
bound
fleet
would
be
laden
with
bullion
from
the
American
mines
The
advantage
lay
with
the
British
when
one
Spanish
warship
ran
aground
and
another
was
captured
but
the
British
commander
failed
to
capitalise
and
the
Spanish
fleet
took
shelter
in
Havana

The
Franco
Spanish
fleet
commanded
by
Don
Juan
Jos
Navarro
drove
off
the
British
fleet
under
Thomas
Mathews
near
Toulon
in
1744
While
Anson
was
pursuing
his
voyage
round
the
world
Spain
was
mainly
intent
on
the
Italian
policy
of
the
King
A
squadron
was
fitted
out
at
C

convey
troops
to
Italy
It
was
watched

Nicholas
Haddock
When

engaged
in
the
struggle
in
Germany
Great
Britain
as
the
ally
of
the
Queen
of
Hungary
Maria
Theresa
France
as
the
supporter
of
the
Bavarian
claimant
of
the
empire
Navarro
and
de
Court
went
on
to
Toulon
where
they
remained
until
February
1744
A
British
fleet
watched
them
under
the
command
of
Admiral
Richard
Lestock
until
Sir
Thomas
Mathews
was
sent
out
as
commander
in
chief
and
as
Minister
to
the
Court
of
Turin
Sporadic
manifestations
of
hostility
between
the
French
and
British
took
place
in
different
seas
but
avowed
war
did
not
begin
until
the
French
government
issued
its
declaration
of
30
March
to
which
Great
Britain
replied
on
31
March
This
formality
had
been
preceded
by
French
preparations
for
the
invasion
of
England
and
by
the
Battle
of
Toulon
between
the
British
and
a
Franco
Spanish
fleet
On
11
February
a
most
confused
battle
was
fought
in
which
the
van
and
centre
of
the
British
fleet
was
engaged
with
the
Spanish
rear
and
centre
of
the
allies
Lestock
who
was
on
the
worst
possible
terms
with
his
superior
took
no
part
in
the
action
Mathews
fought
with
spirit
but
in
a
disorderly
way
breaking
the
formation
of
his
fleet
and
showing
no
power
of
direction
while
Navarro
s
smaller
fleet
retained
cohesion
and
fought
off
the
energetic
but
confused
attacks
of
its
larger
enemy
until
the
arrival
of
the
French
fleet
forced
the
heavily
damaged
British
fleet
to
withdraw
The
Spanish
fleet
then
sailed
to
Italy
where
it
delivered
a
fresh
army
and
supplies
that
had
a
decisive
impact
upon
the
war
The
mismanagement
of
the
British
fleet
in
the
battle
by
arousing
deep
anger
among
the
people
led
to
a
drastic
reform
of
the
British
navy
Northern

The
French
scheme
to
invade
Britain
was
arranged
in
combination
with
the
Jacobite
leaders
and
soldiers
were
to
be
transported
from
Dunkirk
In
February
1744
a
French
fleet
of
twenty
sail
of
the
line
entered
the
English
Channel
under
Jacques
Aymar
comte
de
Roquefeuil
before
the
British
force
under
Admiral
John
Norris
was
ready
to
oppose
him
But
the
French
force
was
ill
equipped
the
admiral
was
nervous
his
mind
dwelt
on
all
the
misfortunes
which
might
possibly
happen
and
the
weather
was
bad
De
Roquefeuil
came
up
almost
as
far
as
The
Downs
where
he
learnt
that
Sir
John
Norris
was
at
hand
with
twenty
five
sail
of
the
line
and
thereupon
precipitately
retreated
The
military
expedition
prepared
at
Dunkirk
to
cross
under
cover
of
De
Roquefeuil
s
fleet
naturally
did
not
start
The
utter
weakness
of
the
French
at
sea
due
to
long
neglect
of
the
fleet
and
the
bankrupt
state
of
the
treasury
was
shown
during
the
Jacobite
rising
of
1745
when
France
made
no
attempt
to
profit
by
the
distress
of
the
British
government
The
Dutch
having
by
this
time
joined
Great
Britain
made
a
serious
addition
to
the
naval
power
opposed
to
France
though
the
Dutch
Republic
was
compelled
by
the
necessity
for
maintaining
an
army
in
Flanders
to
play
a
very
subordinate
part
at
sea
Not
being
stimulated
by
formidable
attack
and
having
immediate
interests
both
at
home
and
in
Germany
the
British
government
was
slow
to
make
use
of
its
latest
naval
strength
Spain
which
could
do
nothing
of
an
offensive
character
was
almost
neglected
During
1745
the
New
England
expedition
which
took
Louisburg
30
April
16
June
was
covered
by
a
British
naval
force
but
little
else
was
accomplished
by
the
naval
efforts
of
any
of
the
belligerents
In
1746
a
British
combined
naval
and
military
expedition
to
the
coast
of
France
the
first
of
a
long
series
of
similar
ventures
which
in
the
end
were
derided
as
breaking
windows
with
guineas
was
carried
out
during
August
and
October
The
aim
was
the
capture
of
the
French
East
India
Company
s
dockyard
at
Lorient
but
it
was
not
attained
126
From
1747
until
the
close
of
the
war
in
October
1748
the
naval
policy
of
the
British
government
without
reaching
a
high
level
was
more
energetic
and
coherent
A
closer
watch
was
kept
on
the
French
coast
and
effectual
means
were
taken
to
intercept
communication
between
France
and
her
American
possessions
In
the
spring
information
was
obtained
that
an
important
convoy
for
the
East
and
West
Indies
was
to
sail
from
L
Orient
The
convoy
was
intercepted
by
Anson
on
3
May
and
in
the
first
Battle
of
Cape
Finisterre
British
admiral
George
Anson
s
fourteen
ships
of
the
line
wiped
out
the
French
escort
of
six
ships
of
the
line
and
three
armed
Indiamen
although
in
the
meantime
the
merchant
ships
escaped
On
14
October
another
French
convoy
protected
by
a
strong
squadron
was
intercepted
by
a
well
appointed
and
well
directed
squadron
of
superior
numbers
the
squadrons
were
respectively
eight
French
and
fourteen
British
in
the
Bay
of
Biscay
In
the
second
Battle
of
Cape
Finisterre
which
followed
the
French
admiral
Henri
Fran
ois
des
Herbiers
l
tendu
re
succeeded
in
covering
the
escape
of
most
of
the
merchant
ships
but
Hawke
s
British
squadron
took
six
of
his
warships
Most
of
the
merchantmen
were
later
intercepted
and
captured
in
the
West
Indies
This
disaster
convinced
the
French
government
of
its
helplessness
at
sea
and
it
made
no
further
effort

The
Seven
Years
War
was
a
global
conflict
fought
between
1756
and
1763
It
involved
every
European
great
power
of
the
time
and
spanned
five
continents
affecting
Europe
the
Americas
West
Africa
India
and
the
Philippines
The
conflict
split
Europe
into
two
coalitions
led
by
the
Kingdom
of
Great
Britain
including
Prussia
Portugal
Hanover
and
other
small
German
states
on
one
side
and
the
Kingdom
of
France
including
the
Austrian
led
Holy
Roman
Empire
the
Russian
Empire
Bourbon
Spain
and
Sweden
on
the
other
Meanwhile
in
India
the
Mughal
Empire
with
the
support
of
the
French
tried
to
crush
a
British
attempt
to
conquer
Bengal
Although
Anglo
French
skirmishes
over
their
American
colonies
had
begun
with
what
became
the
French
and
Indian
War
in
1754
the
large
scale
conflict
that
drew
in
most
of
the
European
powers
was
centered
on
Austria
s
desire
to
recover
Silesia
from
the
Prussians
Seeing
the
opportunity
to
curtail
Britain
s
and
Prussia
s
ever
growing
might
France
and
Austria
put
aside
their
ancient
rivalry
to
form
a
grand
coalition
of
their
own
bringing
most
of
the
other
European
powers
to
their
side
Faced
with
this
sudden
turn
of
events
Britain
aligned
itself
with
Prussia
in
a
series
of
political
manoeuvres
known
as
the
Diplomatic
Revolution
However
French
efforts
ended
in
failure
when
the
Anglo
Prussian
coalition
prevailed
and
Britain
s
rise
as
among
the
world
s
predominant
powers
destroyed
France
s
supremacy
in
Europe
thus
altering
the
European
balance
of
power

Summary
edit
Conflict
between
Great
Britain
and
France
broke
out
in
1754
1756
when
the
British
attacked
disputed
French
positions
in
North
America
starting
with
a
British
ambush
of
a
small
French
force
at
the
Battle
of
Jumonville
Glen
on
28
May
1754
and
extended
across
the
colonial
boundaries
and
the
seizure
of
hundreds
of
French
merchant
ships
at
sea
Meanwhile
rising
power
Prussia
was
struggling
with
Austria
for
dominance
within
and
outside
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
in
central
Europe
In
1756
the
major
powers
switched
partners
Realizing
that
war
was
imminent
Prussia
preemptively
struck
Saxony
and
quickly
overran
it
The
result
caused
uproar
across
Europe
Because
of
Austria
s
alliance
with
France
to
recapture
Silesia
which
had
been
lost
in
the
War
of
the
Austrian
Succession
Prussia
formed
an
alliance
with
Britain
Reluctantly
by
following
the
imperial
diet
which
declared
war
on
Prussia
on
17
January
1757
most
of
the
states
of
the
empire
joined
Austria
s
cause
The
Anglo
Prussian
alliance
was
joined
by
smaller
German
states
especially
the
Electorate
of
Hanover
Sweden
seeking
to
re
gain
Pomerania
most
of
which
had
been
lost
to
Prussia
in
previous
wars
joined
the
coalition
seeing
its
chance
when
virtually
all
of
Europe
opposed
Prussia
Spain
bound
by
the
Pacte
de
Famille
intervened
on
behalf
of
France
and
together
they
launched
an
utterly
unsuccessful
invasion
of
Portugal
in
1762
The
Russian
Empire
was
originally
aligned
with
Austria
fearing
Prussia
s
ambition
on
the
Polish
Lithuanian
Commonwealth
but
switched
sides
upon
the
succession
of
Tsar
Peter
III
in
1762
Many
middle
and
small
powers
in
Europe
unlike
in
the
previous
wars
tried
to
steer
clear
away
from
the
escalating
conflict
even
though
they
had
interests
in
the
conflict
or
with
the
belligerents
like
Denmark
Norway
Denmark
Norway
was
however
close
to
being
dragged
into
the
war
on
France
s
side
when
Peter
III
became
Russian
emperor
and
switched
sides
Dano
Norwegian
and
Russian
armies
were
close
to
ending
up
in
battle
but
the
Russian
emperor
was
deposed
before
war
formally
broke
out
The
Dutch
Republic
a
long
time
British
ally
kept
its
neutrality
intact
fearing
the
odds
against
Britain
and
Prussia
fighting
the
great
powers
of
Europe
and
even
tried
to
prevent
Britain
s
domination
in
India
Naples
Sicily
and
Savoy
although
sided
with
the
Franco
Spanish
alliance
declined
to
join
the
coalition
under
fear
of
British
naval
power
The
taxation
needed
for
war
caused
the
Russian
people
considerable
hardship
being
added
to
the
taxation
of
salt
and
alcohol
begun
by
Empress
Elizabeth
in
1759
to
complete
her
addition
to
the
Winter
Palace
Like
Sweden
Russia
concluded
a
separate
peace
with
Prussia
The
war
ended
with
the
Treaty
of
Paris
between
France
Spain
and
Great
Britain
and
the
Treaty
of
Hubertusburg
between
Saxony
Austria
and
Prussia
in
1763
The
war
was
successful
for
Great
Britain
which
gained
the
bulk
of
New
France
in
North
America
Spanish
Florida
some
individual
Caribbean
islands
in
the
West
Indies
the
colony
of
Senegal
on
the
West
African
coast
and
superiority
over
the
French
trading
outposts
on
the
Indian
subcontinent
The
Native
American
tribes
were
excluded
from
the
settlement
a
subsequent
conflict
known
as
Pontiac
s
War
was
also
unsuccessful
in
returning
them
to
their
pre
war
status
In
Europe
the
war
began
disastrously
for
Prussia
but
a
combination
of
good
luck
and
successful
strategy
saw
King
Frederick
the
Great
manage
to
retrieve
the
Prussian
position
and
retain
the
status
quo
ante
bellum
Prussia
emerged
as
a
new
European
great
power
Although
Austria
failed
to
retrieve
the
territory
of
Silesia
from
Prussia
its
original
goal
its
military
prowess
was
also
noted
by
the
other
powers
The
involvement
of
Portugal
Spain
and
Sweden
did
not
return
them
to
their
former
status
as
great
powers
France
was
deprived
of
many
of
its
colonies
and
had
saddled
itself
with
heavy
war
debts
that
its
inefficient
financial
system
could
barely
handle
Spain
lost
Florida
but
gained
French
Louisiana
and
regained
control
of
its
colonies
e
g
Cuba
and
the
Philippines
which
had
been
captured
by
the
British
during
the
war
France
and
Spain
avenged
their
defeat
during
the
American
Revolutionary
War
with
hopes
of
destroying
Britain
s
dominance
once
and
for
all
The
Seven
Years
War
was
perhaps
the
first
true
world
war
having
taken
place
almost
160
years
before
World
War
I
and
influenced
many
major
events
later
around
the
globe
The
war

Sweden
with
allies
In
the
War
of
the
Austrian
Succession
7
which
lasted
from
1740
to
1748
King
Frederick
II
of
Prussia
known
as
Frederick
the
Great
seized
the
prosperous
province
of
Silesia
from
Austria
Empress
Maria
Theresa
of
Austria
had
signed
the
Treaty
of
Aix
la
Chapelle
in
1748
in
order
to
gain
time
to
rebuild
her
military
forces
and
forge
new
alliances
The
War
of
the
Austrian
Succession
had
seen
the
belligerents
aligned
on
a
time
honoured
basis
France
s
traditional
enemies
Great
Britain
and
Austria
had
coalesced
just
as
they
had
done
against
Louis
XIV
Prussia
the
leading
anti
Austrian
state
in
Germany
had
been
supported
by
France
Neither
group
however
found
much
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
its
partnership
British
subsidies
to
Austria
produced
nothing
of
much
help
to
the
British
while
the
British
military
effort
had
not
saved
Silesia
for
Austria
Prussia
having
secured
Silesia
came
to
terms
with
Austria
in
disregard
of
French
interests
Even
so
France
concluded
a
defensive
alliance
with
Prussia
in
1747
and
the
maintenance
of
the
Anglo
Austrian
alignment
after
1748
was
deemed
essential
by
the
Duke
of
Newcastle
British
secretary
of
state
in
the
ministry
of
his
brother
Henry
Pelham
The
collapse
of
that
system
and
the
aligning
of
France
with
Austria
and
of
Great
Britain
with
Prussia
constituted
what
is
known
as
the
diplomatic
revolution
or
the
reversal
of
alliances
In
1756
Austria
was
making
military
preparations
for
war
with
Prussia
and
pursuing
an
alliance
with
Russia
for
this
purpose
On
2
June
1746
Austria
and
Russia
concluded
a
defensive
alliance
that
covered
their
own
territory
and
Poland
against
attack
by
Prussia
or
the
Ottoman
Empire
They
also
agreed
to
a
secret
clause
that
promised
the
restoration
of
Silesia
and
the
countship
of
Glatz
now
K
odzko
Poland
to
Austria
in
the
event
of
hostilities
with
Prussia
Their
real
desire
however
was
to
destroy
Frederick
s
power
altogether
reducing
his
sway
to
his
electorate
of
Brandenburg
and
giving
East
Prussia
to
Poland
an
exchange
that
would
be
accompanied
by
the
cession
of
the
Polish
Duchy
of
Courland
to
Russia
Alexey
Bestuzhev
Ryumin
grand
chancellor
of
Russia
under
Empress
Elizabeth
was
hostile
to
both
France
and
Prussia
but
he
could
not
persuade
Austrian
statesman
Wenzel
Anton
von
Kaunitz
to
commit
to
offensive
designs
against
Prussia
so
long
as
Prussia
was
able
to
rely
on
French
support
Europe
in
the
years
after
the
Treaty
of
Aix
la
Chapelle
in
1748
The
Hanoverian
king
George
II
of
Great
Britain
was
passionately
devoted
to
his
family
s
continental
holdings
but
his
commitments
in
Germany
were
counterbalanced
by
the
demands
of
the
British
colonies
overseas
If
war
against
France
for
colonial
expansion
was
to
be
resumed
then
Hanover
had
to
be
secured
against
Franco
Prussian
attack
France
was
very
much
interested
in
colonial
expansion
and
was
willing
to
exploit
the
vulnerability
of
Hanover
in
war
against
Great
Britain
but
it
had
no
desire
to
divert
forces
to
central
Europe
for
Prussia
s
interest
French
policy
was
moreover
complicated
by
the
existence
of
the
Secret
du
Roi
a
system
of
private
diplomacy
conducted
by
King
Louis
XV
Unbeknownst
to
his
foreign
minister
Louis
had
established
a
network
of
agents
throughout
Europe
with
the
goal
of
pursuing
personal
political
objectives
that
were
often
at
odds
with
France
s
publicly
stated
policies
Louis
s
goals
for
le
Secret
du
roi
included
the
Polish
crown
for
his
kinsman
Louis
Fran
ois
de
Bourbon
prince
de
Conti
and
the
maintenance
of
Poland
Sweden
and
Turkey
as
French
client
states
in
opposition
to
Russian
and
Austrian
interests
Frederick
saw
Saxony
and
Polish
west
Prussia
as
potential
fields
for
expansion
but
could
not
expect
French
support
if
he
started
an
aggressive
war
for
them
If
he
joined
the
French
against
the
British
in
the
hope
of
annexing
Hanover
he
might
fall
victim
to
an
Austro
Russian
attack
The
hereditary
elector
of
Saxony
Augustus
III
was
also
elective
King
of
Poland
as
Augustus
III
but
the
two
territories
were
physically
separated
by
Brandenburg
and
Silesia
Neither
state
could
pose
as
a
great
power
Saxony
was
merely
a
buffer
between
Prussia
and
Austrian
Bohemia
whereas
Poland
despite
its
union
with
the
ancient
lands
of
Lithuania
was
prey
to
pro
French
and
pro
Russian
factions
A
Prussian
scheme
for
compensating
Frederick
Augustus
with
Bohemia
in
exchange
for
Saxony
obviously
presupposed
further
spoliation
of
Austria
In
the
attempt
to
satisfy
Austria
at
the
time
Britain
gave
their
electoral
vote
in
Hanover
for
the
candidacy
of
Maria
Theresa
s
son
Joseph
II
as
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
much
to
the
dismay
of
Frederick
and
Prussia
Not
only
that
Britain
would
soon
join
the
Austro
Russian
alliance
but
complications
arose
Britain
s
basic
framework
for
the
alliance
itself
was
to
protect
Hanover
s
interests
against
France
At
the
same
time
Kaunitz
kept
approaching
the
French
in
the
hope
of
establishing
just
such
an
alliance
with
Austria
Not
only
that
France
had
no
intention
to
ally
with
Russia
who
years
earlier
had
meddled
in
France
s
affairs
during
Austria
s
succession
war
France
also
saw
the
dismemberment
of
Prussia
as
threatening
to
the
stability
of
Central
Europe
Years
later
Kaunitz
kept
trying
to
establish
France
s
alliance
with
Austria
He
tried
as
hard
as
he
could
to
avoid
Austrian
entanglement
in
Hanover
s
political
affairs
and
was
even
willing
to
trade
Austrian
Netherlands
for
France
s
aid
in
recapturing
Silesia
Frustrated
by
this
decision
and
by
the
Dutch
Republic
s
insistence
on
neutrality
Britain
soon
turned
to
Russia
On
30
September
1755
Britain
pledged
financial
aid
to
Russia
in
order
to
station
50
000
troops
on
the
Livonian
Lithuanian
border
so
they
could
defend
Britain
s
interests
in
Hanover
immediately
Besthuzev
assuming
the
preparation
was
directed
against
Prussia
was
more
than
happy
to
obey
the
request
of
the
British
Unbeknownst
to
the
other
powers
King
George
II
also
made
overtures
to
the
Prussian
king
Frederick
who
fearing
the
Austro
Russian
intentions
was
also
desirous
of
a
rapprochement
with
Britain
On
16
January
1756
the
Convention
of
Westminster
was
signed
whereby
Britain
and
Prussia
promised
to
aid
one
another
the
parties
hoped
to
achieve
lasting
peace
and
stability
in
Europe
The
carefully
coded
word
in
the
agreement
proved
no
less
catalytic
for
the
other
European
powers
The
results
were
absolute
chaos
Empress
Elizabeth
of
Russia
was
outraged
at
the
duplicity
of
Britain
s
position
Not
only
that
but
France
was
enraged
and
terrified
by
the
sudden
betrayal
of
its
only
ally
Austria
particularly
Kaunitz
used
this
situation
to
their
utmost
advantage
Now
isolated
France
was
forced
to
accede
to
the
Austro
Russian
alliance
or
face
ruin
Thereafter
on
1
May
1756
the
First
Treaty
of
Versailles
was
signed
in
which
both
nations
pledged
24
000
troops
to
defend
each
other
in
the
case
of
an
attack
This
diplomatic
revolution
proved
to
be
an
important
cause
of
the
war
although
both
treaties
were
self
defensive
in
nature
the
actions
of
both
coalitions
made
the
war
virtually
inevitable

Map
of
the
British
and
French
settlements
in
North
America
in
1750
before
the
French
and
Indian
War
1754
to
1763
that
was
part
of
the
Seven
Years
War
The
boundary
between
British
and
French
possessions
in
North
America
was
largely
undefined
in
the
1750s
France
had
long
claimed
the
entire
Mississippi
River
basin
This
was
disputed
by
Britain
In
the
early
1750s
the
French
began
constructing
a
chain
of
forts
in
the
Ohio
River
Valley
to
assert
their
claim
and
shield
the
Native
American
population
from
increasing
British
influence
The
British
settlers
along
the
coast
were
upset
that
French
troops
would
now
be
close
to
the
western
borders
of
their
colonies
They
felt
the
French
would
encourage
their
tribal
allies
among
the
North
American
natives
to
attack
them
Also
the
British
settlers
wanted
access
to
the
fertile
land
of
the
Ohio
River
Valley
for
the
new
settlers
that
were
flooding
into
the
British
colonies
seeking
farm
land
8
The
most
important
French
fort
planned
was
intended
to
occupy
a
position
at
the
Forks
where
the
Allegheny
and
Monongahela
Rivers
meet
to
form
the
Ohio
River
present
day
Pittsburgh
Pennsylvania
Peaceful
British
attempts
to
halt
this
fort
construction
were
unsuccessful
and
the
French
proceeded
to
build
the
fort
they
named
Fort
Duquesne
British
colonial
militia
from
Virginia
were
then
sent
to
drive
them
out
Led
by
George
Washington
they
ambushed
a
small
French
force
at
Jumonville
Glen
on
28
May
1754
killing
ten
including
commander
Jumonville
9
The
French
retaliated
by
attacking
Washington
s
army
at
Fort
Necessity
on
3
July
1754
and
forced
Washington
to
surrender
10
These
were
the
first
engagements
of
what
would
become
the
worldwide
Seven
Years
War
News
of
this
arrived
in
Europe
where
Britain
and
France
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
negotiate
a
solution
The
two
nations
eventually
dispatched
regular
troops
to
North
America
to
enforce
their
claims
The
first
British
action
was
the
assault
on
Acadia
on
16
June
1755
in
the
Battle
of
Fort
Beaus
jour
11
which
was
immediately
followed
by
their
expulsion
of
the
Acadians
12
In
July
British
Major
General
Edward
Braddock
led
about
2
000
army
troops
and
provincial
militia
on
an
expedition
to
retake
Fort
Duquesne
but
the
expedition
ended
in
disastrous
defeat
13
In
further
action
Admiral
Edward
Boscawen
fired
on
the
French
ship
Alcide
on
8
June
1755
capturing
it
and
two
troop
ships
In
September
1755
British
colonial
and
French
troops
met
in
the
inconclusive
Battle
of
Lake
George
14
The
British
also
harassed
French
shipping
beginning
in
August
1755
seizing
hundreds
of
ships
and
capturing
thousands
of
merchant
seamen
while
the
two
nations
were
nominally
at
peace
Incensed
France
prepared
to
attack
Hanover
whose
prince
elector
was
also
the
King
of
Great
Britain
and
Menorca
Britain
concluded
a
treaty
whereby
Prussia
agreed
to
protect
Hanover
In
response
France
concluded
an
alliance
with
its
long
time
enemy
Austria
an
event
known
as
the
Diplomatic
Revolution
Strategies
edit
For
much
of
the
eighteenth
century
France
approached
its
wars
in
the
same
way
It
would
let
colonies
defend
themselves
or
would
offer
only
minimal
help
sending
them
limited
numbers
of
troops
or
inexperienced
soldiers
anticipating
that
fights
for
the
colonies
would
most
likely
be
lost
anyway
15
This
strategy
was
to
a
degree
forced
upon
France
geography
coupled
with
the
superiority
of
the
British
navy
made
it
difficult
for
the
French
navy
to
provide
significant
supplies
and
support
to
overseas
colonies
16
Similarly
several
long
land
borders
made
an
effective
domestic
army
imperative
for
any
French
ruler
17
Given
these
military
necessities
the
French
government
unsurprisingly
based
its
strategy
overwhelmingly
on
the
army
in
Europe
it
would
keep
most
of
its
army
on
the
continent
hoping
for
victories
closer
to
home
17
The
plan
was
to
fight
to
the
end
of
hostilities
and
then
in
treaty
negotiations
to
trade
territorial
acquisitions
in
Europe
to
regain
lost
overseas
possessions
as
had
happened
in
e
g
the
Treaty
of
Saint
Germain
en
Laye
1632
This
approach
did
not
serve
France
well
in
the
war
as
the
colonies
were
indeed
lost
but
although
much
of
the
European
war
went
well
by
its
end
France
had
few
counterbalancing
European
successes
18
Prussian

battalion

Kolin
1757
The
British
by
inclination
as
well
as
for
practical
reasons
had
tended
to
avoid
large
scale
commitments
of
troops
on
the
continent
19
They
sought
to
offset
the
disadvantage
of
this
in
Europe
by
allying
themselves
with
one
or
more
continental
powers
whose
interests
were
antithetical
to
those
of
their
enemies
particularly
France
20
15
16
By
subsidising
the
armies
of
continental
allies
Britain
could
turn
London
s
enormous
financial
power
to
military
advantage
In
the
Seven
Years
War
the
British
chose
as
their
principal
partner
the
most
brilliant
general
of
the
day
Frederick
the
Great
of
Prussia
then
the
rising
power
in
central
Europe
and
paid
Frederick
substantial
subsidies
for
his
campaigns
20
106
This
was
accomplished
in
the
diplomatic
revolution
of
1756
in
which
Britain
ended
its
long
standing
alliance
with
Austria
in
favor
of
Prussia
leaving
Austria
to
side
with
France
In
marked
contrast
to
France
Britain
strove
to
prosecute
the
war
actively
in
the
colonies
taking
full
advantage
of
its
naval
power
21
22
64
66
The
British
pursued
a
dual
strategy
naval
blockade
and
bombardment
of
enemy
ports
and
rapid
movement
of
troops
by
sea
23
They
harassed
enemy
shipping
and
attacked
enemy
colonies
frequently
using
colonists
from
nearby
British
colonies
in
the
effort
The
Russians
and
the
Austrians
were
determined
to
reduce
the
power
of
Prussia
the
new
threat
on
their
doorstep
Along
with
France
they
agreed
in
1756
to
mutual
defense
and
an
attack
by
Austria
and
Russia
on
Prussia
subsidized
by
France

William
Pitt
the
Elder
who
entered
the
cabinet
in
1756
had
a
grand
vision
for
the
war
that
made
it
entirely
different
from
previous
wars
with
France
As
prime
minister
Pitt
committed
Britain
to
a
grand
strategy
of
seizing
the
entire
French
Empire
especially
its
possessions
in
North
America
and
India
Britain
s
main
weapon
was
the
Royal
Navy
which
could
control
the
seas
and
bring
as
many
invasion
troops
as
were
needed
He
also
planned
to
use
colonial
forces
from
the
thirteen
American
colonies
working
under
the
command
of
British
regulars
to
invade
New
France
In
order
to
tie
the
French
army
down
he
subsidized
his
European
allies
Pitt
was
head
of
the
government
from
1756
to
1761
and
even
after
that
the
British
continued
his
strategy
It
proved
completely
successful
25
Pitt
had
a
clear
appreciation
of
the
enormous
value
of
imperial
possessions
and
realized
the
vulnerability
of
the
French
Empire

Admiral
John
Byng
s
account
of
the
Battle
of
Minorca
1756
The
British
prime
minister
the
Duke
of
Newcastle
was
optimistic
that
the
new
series
of
alliances
could
prevent
war
from
breaking
out
in
Europe
27
However
a
large
French
force
was
assembled
at
Toulon
and
the
French
opened
the
campaign
against
the
British
by
an
attack
on
Menorca
in
the
Mediterranean
A
British
attempt
at
relief
was
foiled
at
the
Battle
of
Minorca
and
the
island
was
captured
on
28
June
for
which
Admiral
Byng
was
court
martialed
and
executed
28
Britain
formally
declared
war
on
France
on
17
May
29
nearly
two
years
after
fighting
had
broken
out
in
the
Ohio
Country
Battle
of
Lobositz
Austria
blue
Prussia
red
Frederick
II
of
Prussia
had
received
reports
of
the
clashes
in
North
America
and
had
formed
an
alliance
with
Great
Britain
On
29
August
1756
he
led
Prussian
troops
across
the
border
of
Saxony
one
of
the
small
German
states
in
league
with
Austria
He
intended
this
as
a
bold
pre
emption
of
an
anticipated
Austro
French
invasion
of
Silesia
He
had
three
goals
in
his
new
war
on
Austria
First
he
would
seize
Saxony
and
eliminate
it
as
a
threat
to
Prussia
then
use
the
Saxon
army
and
treasury
to
aid
the
Prussian
war
effort
His
second
goal
was
to
advance
into
Bohemia
where
he
might
set
up
winter
quarters
at
Austria
s
expense
Thirdly
he
wanted
to
invade
Moravia
from
Silesia
seize
the
fortress
at
Olm
tz
and
advance
on
Vienna
to
force
an
end
to
the
war
30
Accordingly
leaving
Field
Marshal
Count
Kurt
von
Schwerin
in
Silesia
with
25
000
soldiers
to
guard
against
incursions
from
Moravia
and
Hungary
and
leaving
Field
Marshal
Hans
von
Lehwaldt
in
East
Prussia
to
guard
against
Russian
invasion
from
the
east
Frederick
set
off
with
his
army
for
Saxony
The
Prussian
army
marched
in
three
columns
On
the
right
was
a
column
of
about
15
000
men
under
the
command
of
Prince
Ferdinand
of
Brunswick
On
the
left
was
a
column
of
18
000
men
under
the
command
of
the
Duke
of
Brunswick
Bevern
In
the
centre
was
Frederick
II
himself
with
Field
Marshal
James
Keith
commanding
a
corps
of
30
000
troops
30
Ferdinand
of
Brunswick
was
to
close
in
on
the
town
of
Chemnitz
The
Duke
of
Brunswick
Bevern
was
to
traverse
Lusatia
to
close
in
on
Bautzen
Meanwhile
Frederick
and
Keith
would
make
for
Dresden
The
Saxon
and
Austrian
armies
were
unprepared
and
their
forces
were
scattered
Frederick
occupied
Dresden
with
little
or
no
opposition
from
the
Saxons
31
At
the
Battle
of
Lobositz
on
1
October
1756
Frederick
prevented
the
isolated
Saxon
army
from
being
reinforced
by
an
Austrian
army
under
General
Browne
32
The
Prussians
then
occupied
Saxony
after
the
Siege
of
Pirna
the
Saxon
army
surrendered
in
October
1756
and
was
forcibly
incorporated
into
the
Prussian
army
The
attack
on
neutral
Saxony
caused
outrage
across
Europe
and
led
to
the
strengthening
of
the
anti
Prussian
coalition
33
The
only
significant
Austrian
success
was
the
partial
occupation
of
Silesia
Far
from
being
easy
Frederick
s
early
successes
proved
indecisive
and
very
costly
for
Prussia
s
smaller
army
This
led
him
to
remark
that
he
did
not
fight
the
same
Austrians
as
he
had
during
the
previous
war
34
Britain
had
been
surprised
by
the
sudden
Prussian
offensive
but
now
began
shipping
supplies
and
670
000
equivalent
to
89
9
million
in
2016
to
its
new
ally
35
A
combined
force
of
allied
German
states
was
organised
by
the
British
to
protect
Hanover
from
French
invasion
under
the
command
of
the
Duke
of
Cumberland
36
The
British
attempted
to
persuade
the
Dutch
Republic
to
join
the
alliance
but
the
request
was
rejected
as
the
Dutch
wished
to
remain
fully
neutral
37
Despite
the
huge
disparity
in
numbers
the
year
had
been
successful
for
the
Prussian
led
forces
on
the
continent
in
contrast
to
the
British
campaigns
in
North
America
1757
edit
Battle
of
Kolin
See
also
Pomeranian
War
On
18
April
1757
Frederick
II
again
took
the
initiative
by
marching
into
the
Kingdom
of
Bohemia
hoping
to
inflict
a
decisive
defeat
on
Austrian
forces
38
After
winning
the
bloody
Battle
of
Prague
on
6
May
1757
in
which
both
forces
suffered
major
casualties
the
Prussians
forced
the
Austrians
back
into
the
fortifications
of
Prague
The
Prussian
army
then
laid
siege
to
the
city
39
In
response
Austrian
commander
Leopold
von
Daun
collected
a
force
of
30
000
men
to
come
to
the
relief
of
Prague
40
Following
the
battle
at
Prague
Frederick
took
5
000
troops
from
the
siege
at
Prague
and
sent
them
to
reinforce
the
19
000
man
army
under
the
Duke
of
Brunswick
Bevern
at
Kolin
in
Bohemia
41
Von
Daun
arrived
too
late
to
participate
in
the
battle
of
Prague
but
picked
up
16
000
men
who
had
escaped
from
the
battle
With
this
army
he
slowly
moved
to
relieve
Prague
The
Prussian
army
was
too
weak
to
simultaneously
besiege
Prague
and
keep
von
Daun
away
and
Frederick
was
forced
to
attack
prepared
positions
The
resulting
Battle
of
Kolin
was
a
sharp
defeat
for
Frederick
his
first
His
losses
further
forced
him
to
lift
the
siege
and
withdraw
from
Bohemia
altogether
42
Battle
of
Rossbach
Later
that
summer
the
Russians
under
Field
Marshal
Stepan
Fyodorovich
Apraksin
besieged
Memel
with
75
000
troops
Memel
had
one
of
the
strongest
fortresses
in
Prussia
However
after
five
days
of
artillery
bombardment
the
Russian
army
was
able
to
storm
it
43
The
Russians
then
used
Memel
as
a
base
to
invade
East
Prussia
and
defeated
a
smaller
Prussian
force
in
the
fiercely
contested
Battle
of
Gross
J
gersdorf
on
30
August
1757
In
the
words
of
the
American
historian
Daniel
Marston
Gross
J
gersdorf
left
the
Prussians
with
a
newfound
respect
for
the
fighting
capabilities
of
the
Russians
that
was
reinforced
in
the
later
battles
of
Zorndorf
and
Kunersdorf
44
However
the
Russians
were
not
yet
able
to
take
K
nigsberg
after
using
up
their
supplies
of
cannonballs
at
Memel
and
Gross
J
gersdorf
and
retreated
soon
afterward
A
recurring
problem
for
the
Russians
throughout
the
war
was
their
logistics
45
The
Russians
lacked
a
quartermaster
s
department
capable
of
keeping
armies
operating
in
Central
Europe
properly
supplied
over
the
primitive
mud
roads
of
eastern
Europe
45
The
tendency
of
Russian
armies
to
break
off
operations
after
fighting
a
major
battle
even
when
they
were
not
defeated
was
less
about
their
casualties
and
more
about
their
supply
lines
after
expending
much
of
their
munitions
in
a
battle
Russian
generals
did
not
wish
to
risk
another
battle
knowing
resupply
would
be
a
long
time
coming
45
This
long
standing
weakness
was
evident
in
the
Russian
Ottoman
War
of
1735
1739
where
Russian
battle
victories
led
to
only
modest
war
gains
due
to
problems
supplying
their
armies
46
The
Russian
quartermasters
department
had
not
improved
so
the
same
problems
reoccurred
in
Prussia
46
Still
the
Imperial
Russian
Army
was
a
new
threat
to
Prussia
Not
only
was
Frederick
forced
to
break
off
his
invasion
of
Bohemia
he
was
now
forced
to
withdraw
further
into
Prussian
controlled
territory
47
His
defeats
on
the
battlefield
brought
still
more
opportunistic
nations
into
the
war
Sweden
declared
war
on
Prussia
and
invaded
Pomerania
with
17
000
men
43
Sweden
felt
this
small
army
was
all
that
was
needed
to
occupy
Pomerania
and
felt
the
Swedish
army
would
not
need
to
engage
with
the
Prussians
because
the
Prussians
were
occupied
on
so
many
other
fronts
Battle
of
Leuthen
by
Carl
R
chling
Frederick
and
staff
at
Leuthen
Things
were
looking
grim
for
Prussia
now
with
the
Austrians
mobilising
to
attack
Prussian
controlled
soil
and
a
combined
French
and
Reichsarmee
German
states
army
under
Prince
Soubise
approaching
from
the
west
The
Reichsarmee
was
a
collection
of
armies
from
the
smaller
German
states
that
banded
together
to
heed
the
appeal
of
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
Franz
I
against
Frederick
48
However
in
November
and
December
1757
the
whole
situation
in
Germany
was
reversed
First
Frederick
devastated
Soubise
s
forces
at
the
Battle
of
Rossbach
on
5
November
1757
49
and
then
routed
a
vastly
superior
Austrian
force
at
the
Battle
of
Leuthen
on
5
December
1757
50
Rossbach
was
the
only
battle
between
the
French
and
the
Prussians
during
the
entire
war
48
At
Rossbach
the
Prussians
lost
about
548
men
killed
while
the
Franco
German
force
under
Soubise
lost
about
10
000
killed
51
Frederick
always
called
Leuthen
his
greatest
victory
an
assessment
shared
by
many
at
the
time
as
the
Austrian
Army
was
considered
to
be
a
highly
professional
force
51
With
these
victories
Frederick
once
again
established
himself
as
Europe
s
premier
general
and
his
men
as
Europe
s
most
accomplished
soldiers
However
Frederick
missed
an
opportunity
to
completely
destroy
the
Austrian
army
at
Leuthen
and
it
escaped
back
into
Bohemia
He
hoped
the
two
smashing
victories
would
bring
Maria
Theresa
to
the
peace
table
but
she
was
determined
not
to
negotiate
until
she
had
re
taken
Silesia
Maria
Theresia
also
improved
the
Austrians
command
after
Leuthen
by
replacing
her
incompetent
brother
in
law
Charles
of
Lorraine
with
von
Daun
who
was
now
a
field
marshal
This
problem
was
compounded
when
the
main
Hanoverian
army
under
Cumberland
was
defeated
at
the
Battle
of
Hastenbeck
and
forced
to
surrender
entirely
at
the
Convention
of
Klosterzeven
following
a
French
Invasion
of
Hanover
52
The
convention
removed
Hanover
from
the
war
leaving
the
western
approach
to
Prussian
territory
extremely
vulnerable
Frederick
sent
urgent
requests
to
Britain
for
more
substantial
assistance
as
he
was
now
without
any
outside
military
support
for
his
forces
in
Germany
53
Battle
of
Quiberon
Bay
Calculating
that
no
further
Russian
advance
was
likely
until
1758
Frederick
moved
the
bulk
of
his
eastern
forces
to
Pomerania
under
the
command
of
Marshal
Lehwaldt
where
they
were
to
repel
the
Swedish
invasion
In
short
order
the
Prussian
army
drove
the
Swedes
back
occupied
most
of
Swedish
Pomerania
and
blockaded
its
capital
Stralsund
54
George
II
of
Great
Britain
on
the
advice
of
his
British
ministers
after
the
battle
of
Rossbach
revoked
the
Convention
of
Klosterzeven
and
Hanover
reentered
the
war
55
Over
the
winter
the
new
commander
of
the
Hanoverian
forces
Duke
Ferdinand
of
Brunswick
regrouped
his
army
and
launched
a
series
of
offensives
that
drove
the
French
back
across
the
River
Rhine
Ferdinand
s
forces
kept
Prussia
s
western
flank
secure
for
the
rest
of
the
war
56
The
British
had
suffered
further
defeats
in
North
America
particularly
at
Fort
William
Henry
At
home
however
stability
had
been
established
Since
1756
successive
governments
led
by
Newcastle
and
Pitt
had
fallen
In
August
1757
the
two
men
agreed
to
a
political
partnership
and
formed
a
coalition
government
that
gave
new
firmer
direction
to
the
war
effort
The
new
strategy
emphasised
both
Newcastle
s
commitment
to
British
involvement
on
the
continent
particularly
in
defence
of
Germany
and
Pitt
s
determination
to
use
naval
power
to
seize
French
colonies
around
the
globe
This
dual
strategy
would
dominate
British
policy
for
the
next
five
years
Between
10
and
17
October
1757
a
Hungarian
general
Count
Andr
s
Hadik
serving
in
the
Austrian
army
executed
what
may
be
the
most
famous
hussar
action
in
history
When
the
Prussian
king
Frederick
was
marching
south
with
his
powerful
armies
the
Hungarian
general
unexpectedly
swung
his
force
of
5
000
mostly
hussars
around
the
Prussians
and
occupied
part
of
their
capital
Berlin
for
one
night
57
The
city
was
spared
for
a
negotiated
ransom
of
200
000
thalers
57
When
Frederick
heard
about
this
humiliating
occupation
he
immediately
sent
a
larger
force
to
free
the
city
Hadik
however
left
the
city
with
his
hussars
and
safely
reached
the
Austrian
lines
Subsequently
Hadik
was
promoted
to
the
rank
of
marshal
in
the
Austrian
Army
1758
edit
In
early
1758
Frederick
launched
an
invasion
of
Moravia
and
laid
siege
to
Olm
tz
now
Olomouc
Czech
Republic
58
Following
an
Austrian
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Domstadtl
that
wiped
out
a
supply
convoy
destined
for
Olm
tz
Frederick
broke
off
the
siege
and
withdrew
from
Moravia
It
marked
the
end
of
his
final
attempt
to
launch
a
major
invasion
of
Austrian
territory
59
In
January
1758
the
Russians
invaded
East
Prussia
where
the
province
almost
denuded
of
troops
put
up
little
opposition
48
East
Prussia
had
been
occupied
by
Russian
forces
over
the
winter
and
would
remain
under
their
control
until
1762
although
it
was
far
less
strategically
valuable
to
Prussia
than
Brandenburg
or
Silesia
In
any
case
Frederick
did
not
see
the
Russians
as
an
immediate
threat
and
instead
entertained
hopes
of
first
fighting
a
decisive
battle
against
Austria
that
would
knock
them
out
of
the
war

in
which
they
committed
to
pay
him

port

and
the
brief
occupation
of
D
sseldorf
he
was
compelled
by
the
successful
manoeuvering
of
larger
French
forces
to
withdraw
across
the
Rhine
60
By
this
point
Frederick
was
increasingly
concerned
by
the
Russian
advance
from
the
east
and
marched
to
counter
it
Just
east
of
the
Oder
in
Brandenburg
Neumark
at
the
Battle
of
Zorndorf
now
Sarbinowo
Poland
a
Prussian
army
of
35
000
men
under
Frederick
on
25
August
1758
fought
a
Russian
army
of
43
000
commanded
by
Count
William
Fermor
61
Both
sides
suffered
heavy
casualties
the
Prussians
12
800
the
Russians
18
000
but
the
Russians
withdrew
and
Frederick
claimed
victory
62
The
American
historian
Daniel
Marston
described
Zorndorf
as
a
draw
as
both
sides
were
too
exhausted
and
had
taken
such
losses
that
neither
wished
to
fight
another
battle
with
the
other
63
In
the
undecided
Battle
of
Tornow
on
25
September
a
Swedish
army
repulsed
six
assaults
by
a
Prussian
army
but
did
not
push
on
Berlin
following
the
Battle
of
Fehrbellin
64
Battle
of
Hochkirch
The
war
was
continuing
indecisively
when
on
14
October
Marshal
Daun
s
Austrians
surprised
the
main
Prussian
army
at
the
Battle
of
Hochkirch
in
Saxony
65
Frederick
lost
much
of
his
artillery
but
retreated
in
good
order
helped
by
dense
woods
The
Austrians
had
ultimately
made
little
progress
in
the
campaign
in
Saxony
despite
Hochkirch
and
had
failed
to
achieve
a
decisive
breakthrough
After
a
thwarted
attempt
to
take
Dresden
Daun
s
troops
were
forced
to
withdraw
to
Austrian
territory
for
the
winter
so
that
Saxony
remained
under
Prussian
occupation
66
At
the
same
time
the
Russians
failed
in
an
attempt
to
take
Kolberg
in
Pomerania

Ko
obrzeg
Poland
from
the
Prussians
67
In
France
1758
had
been
disappointing
and
in
the
wake
of
this
a
new
chief
minister
the
Duc
de
Choiseul
was
appointed

to
end
the
war
in
1759
by
making
strong
attacks

edit
The
year
1759
saw
several
Prussian
defeats
At
the
Battle
of
Kay
or
Paltzig
the
Russian
Count
Saltykov
with
47
000
Russians
defeated
26
000
Prussians
commanded
by
General
Carl
Heinrich
von
Wedel
Though
the
Hanoverians
defeated
an
army
of
60
000
French
at
Minden
Austrian
general
Daun
forced
the
surrender
of
an
entire
Prussian
corps
of
13
000
in
the
Battle
of
Maxen
Frederick
himself
lost
half
his
army
in
the
Battle
of
Kunersdorf
now
Kunowice
Poland
the
worst
defeat
in
his
military
career
and
one
that
drove
him
to
the
brink
of
abdication
and
thoughts
of
suicide
The
disaster
resulted
partly
from
his
misjudgment
of
the
Russians
who
had
already
demonstrated
their
strength
at
Zorndorf
and
at
Gross
J
gersdorf
now
Motornoye
Russia
and
partly
from
good
cooperation
between
the
Russian
and
Austrian
forces
Battle
of
Maxen
The
French
planned
to
invade
the
British
Isles
during
1759
by
accumulating
troops
near
the
mouth
of
the
Loire
and
concentrating
their
Brest
and
Toulon
fleets
However
two
sea
defeats
prevented
this
In
August
the
Mediterranean
fleet
under
Jean
Fran
ois
de
La
Clue
Sabran
was
scattered
by
a
larger
British
fleet
under
Edward
Boscawen
at
the
Battle
of
Lagos
In
the
Battle
of
Quiberon
Bay
on
20
November
the
British
admiral
Edward
Hawke
with
23
ships
of
the
line
caught
the
French
Brest
fleet
with
21
ships
of
the
line
under
Marshal
de
Conflans
and
sank
captured
or
forced
many
of
them
aground
putting
an
end
to
the
French
plans
Battle
of
Liegnitz
1760
Battle
of
Kunersdorf
The
year
1760
brought
yet
more
Prussian
disasters
The
general
Fouqu
was
defeated
by
the
Austrians
in
the
Battle
of
Landshut
The
French
captured
Marburg
and
the
Swedes
part
of
Pomerania
The
Hanoverians
were
victorious
over
the
French
at
the
Battle
of
Warburg
their
continued
success
preventing
France
from
sending
troops
to
aid
the
Austrians
against
Prussia
in
the
east
Despite
this
the
Austrians
under
the
command
of
General
Laudon
captured
Glatz
now
K
odzko
Poland
in
Silesia
In
the
Battle
of
Liegnitz
Frederick
scored
a
strong
victory
despite
being
outnumbered
three
to
one
The
Russians
under
General
Saltykov
and
Austrians
under
General
Lacy
briefly
occupied
his
capital
Berlin
in
October
but
could
not
hold
it
for
long
Still
the
loss
of
Berlin
to
the
Russians
and
Austrians
was
a
great
blow
to
Frederick
s
prestige
as
many
pointed
out
that
the
Prussians
had
no
hope
of
occupying
temporarily
or
otherwise
St
Petersburg
or
Vienna
The
end
of
that
year
saw
Frederick
once
more
victorious
defeating
the
able
Daun
in
the
Battle
of
Torgau
but
he
suffered
very
heavy
casualties
and
the
Austrians
retreated
in
good
order
Meanwhile
after
the
battle
of
Kunersdorf
the
Russian
army
was
mostly
inactive
due
mostly
to
their
tenuous
supply
lines
68
Russian
logistics
were
so
poor
that
in
October
1759
an
agreement
was
signed
under
which
the
Austrians
undertook
to
supply
the
Russians
as
the
quartermaster
s
department
of
the
Russian
Army
was
badly
strained
by
the
demands
of
Russian
armies
operating
so
far
from
home
45
As
it
was
the
requirement
that
the
Austrian
quartermaster
s
department
supply
both
the
Austrian
and
Russian
armies
proved
beyond
its
capacity
and
in
practice
the
Russians
received
little
in
the
way
of
supplies
from
the
Austrians
45
At
Liegnitz
now
Legnica
Poland
the
Russians
arrived
too
late
to
participate
in
the
battle
They
made
two
attempts
to
storm
the
fortress
of
Kolberg
but
neither
succeeded
The
tenacious
resistance
of
Kolberg
allowed
Frederick
to
focus
on
the
Austrians
instead
of
having
to
split
his
forces
1761

Siege
of
Kolberg

Prussia
began
the
1761
campaign
with
just
100
000
available
troops
many
of
them
new
recruits
and
its
situation
seemed
desperate
69
However
the
Austrian
and
Russian
forces
were
also
heavily
depleted
and
could
not
launch
a
major
offensive
In
February
1761
Duke
Ferdinand
of
Brunswick
surprised
French
troops
at
Langensalza
and
then
advanced
to
besiege
Cassel
in
March
He
was
forced
to
lift
the
siege
and
retreat
after
French
forces
regrouped
and
captured
several
thousand
of
his
men
at
the
Battle
of
Gr
nberg

1763
On
the
eastern
front
progress
was
very
slow
The
Russian
army
was
heavily
dependent
upon
its
main
magazines
in
Poland
and
the
Prussian
army
launched
several
successful
raids
against
them
One
of
them
led
by
general
Platen
in
September
resulted
in
the
loss
of
2
000
Russians
mostly
captured
and
the
destruction
of
5
000
wagons
70
Deprived
of
men
the
Prussians
had
to
resort
to
this
new
sort
of
warfare
raiding
to
delay
the
advance
of
their
enemies
Nonetheless
at
the
end
of
the
year
they
suffered
two
critical
setbacks
The
Russians
under
Zakhar
Chernyshev
and
Pyotr
Rumyantsev
stormed
Kolberg
in
Pomerania
while
the
Austrians
captured
Schweidnitz
The
loss
of
Kolberg
cost
Prussia
its
last
port
on
the
Baltic
Sea
71
A
major
problem
for
the
Russians
throughout
the
war
had
always
been
their
weak
logistics
which
prevented
their
generals
from
following
up
their
victories
and
now
with
the
fall
of
Kolberg
the
Russians
could
at
long
last
supply
their
armies
in
Central
Europe
via
the
sea
72
The
fact
that
the
Russians
could
now
supply
their
armies
over
the
sea
which
was
considerably
faster
and
safer
Prussian
cavalry
could
not
intercept
Russian
ships
in
the
Baltic
than
over
the
land
threatened
to
swing
the
balance
of
power
decisively
against
Prussia
72
In
Britain
it
was
speculated
that
a
total
Prussian
collapse
was
now
imminent
Britain
now
threatened
to
withdraw
its
subsidies
if
Prussia
did
not
consider
offering
concessions
to
secure
peace
As
the
Prussian
armies
had
dwindled
to
just
60
000
men
and
with
Berlin
itself
about
to
come
under
siege
Frederick
s
survival
was
severely
threatened
Then
on
5
January
1762
the
Russian
Empress
Elizabeth
died
Her
Prussophile
successor
Peter
III
at
once
ended
the
Russian
occupation
of
East
Prussia
and
Pomerania
see
the
Treaty
of
Saint
Petersburg
1762
and
mediated
Frederick
s
truce
with
Sweden
He
also
placed
a
corps
of
his
own
troops
under
Frederick
s
command
Frederick
was
then
able
to
muster
a
larger
army
of
120
000
men
and
concentrate
it
against
Austria
70
He
drove
them
from
much
of
Silesia
while
his
brother
Henry
won
a
victory
in
Saxony
in
the
Battle
of
Freiberg
29
October
1762
At
the
same
time
his
Brunswick
allies
captured
the
key
town
of
G
ttingen
and
compounded
this
by
taking
Cassel
1762
brought
two
new
countries
into
the
war
Britain
declared
war
against
Spain
on
4
January
1762
Spain
reacted
by
issuing
their
own
declaration
of
war
against
Britain
on
18
January
73
Portugal
followed
by
joining
the
war
on
Britain
s
side
Spain
aided
by
the
French
launched
an
invasion
of
Portugal
and
succeeded
in
capturing
Almeida
The
arrival
of
British
reinforcements
stalled
a
further
Spanish
advance
and
the
Battle
of
Valencia
de
Alc
ntara
saw
British
Portuguese
forces
overrun
a
major
Spanish
supply
base
The
invaders
were
stopped
on
the
heights
in
front
of
Abrantes
called
the
pass
to
Lisbon
where
the
Anglo
Portuguese
were
entrenched
Eventually
the
Anglo
Portuguese
army
aided
by
guerrillas
and
practicing
a
scorched
earth
strategy

Meanwhile
the
long
British
naval
blockade
of

ports
had
sapped
the
morale
of
the
French
populace
Morale
declined

1763
By
1763
the
war
in
central
Europe
was
essentially
a
stalemate
between
Prussia
and
Austria
Prussia
had
retaken
nearly
all
of
Silesia
from
the
Austrians
and
after
Prussia
s
1762
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Freiberg
Frederick
held
most
of
Saxony
but
not
its
capital
Dresden
His
financial
situation
was
not
dire
but
his
kingdom
was
devastated
and
his
army
severely
weakened
His
manpower
had
dramatically
decreased
and
he
had
lost
so
many
effective
officers
and
generals
that
an
offensive
against
Dresden
seemed
impossible
34
British
subsidies
had
been
stopped
by
the
new
prime
minister
Lord
Bute
and
the
Russian
emperor
had
been
overthrown
by
his
wife
Catherine
who
ended
Russia
s
alliance
with
Prussia
and
withdrew
from
the
war
Austria
however
like
most
participants
was
facing
a
severe
financial
crisis
and
had
to
decrease
the
size
of
its
army
something
which
greatly
affected
its
offensive
power
34
Indeed
after
having
effectively
sustained
a
long
war
its
administration
was
in
disarray
82
By
that
time
it
still
held
Dresden
the
southeastern
parts
of
Saxony
and
the
county
of
Glatz
in
southern
Silesia
but
the
prospect
of
victory
was
dim
without
Russian
support
and
Maria
Theresa
had
largely
given
up
her
hopes
of
re
conquering
Silesia
In
1763
a
peace
settlement
was
reached
at
the
Treaty
of
Hubertusburg
in
which
Glatz
was
returned
to
Prussia
in
exchange
for
the
Prussian
evacuation
of
Saxony
This
ended
the
war
in
central
Europe
The
stalemate
had
really
been
reached
by
1759
1760
Prussia
and
Austria
were
nearly
out
of
money
The
materials
of
both
sides
had
been
largely
consumed
Frederick
was
no
longer
receiving
subsidies
from
Britain
the
Golden
Cavalry
of
St
George
had
produced
nearly
13
million
dollars
equivalent
He
had
melted
and
coined
most
of
the
church
silver
had
ransacked
the
palaces
of
his
kingdom
and
coined
that
silver
and
reduced
his
purchasing
power
by
mixing
it
with
copper
His
banks
capital
was
exhausted
and
he
had
pawned
nearly
everything
of
value
from
his
own
estate
While
Frederick
still
had
a
significant
amount
of
money
left
from
the
prior
British
subsidies
he
hoped
to
use
it
to
restore
his
kingdom
s
prosperity
in
peacetime
in
any
case
Prussia
s
population
was
so
depleted
that
he
could
not
sustain
another
long
campaign
83
Similarly
Marie
Theresa
had
reached
the
limit
of
her
resources
She
had
pawned
her
jewels
in
1758
in
1760
she
approved
a
public
subscription
for
support
and
urged
her
public
to
bring
their
silver
to
the
mint
French
subsidies
were
no
longer
provided
84
Although
she
had
many
young
men
still
to
draft
she
could
not
conscript
them
and
did
not
dare
to
resort
to
the
impressment
Frederick
had
done
85
She
had
even
dismissed
some
men
because
it
was
too
expensive
to
feed
them

British
amphibious
descents

Raid
on
Rochefort
Great
Britain
planned
a
descent
an
amphibious
demonstration
or
raid
on
Rochefort
a
joint
operation
to
overrun
the
town
and
burn
shipping
in
the
Charente
The
expedition
set
out
on
8
September
1757
Sir
John
Mordaunt
commanding
the
troops
and
Sir
Edward
Hawke
the
fleet
On
23
September
the
Isle
d
Aix
was
taken
but
military
staff
dithered
and
lost
so
much
time
that
Rochefort
became
unassailable
86
The
expedition
abandoned
the
Isle
d
Aix
returning
to
Great
Britain
on
1
October
Under
Pitt
s
leadership
Britain
s
position
as
the
leading
colonial
power
was
confirmed
by
the
Seven
Years
War
Despite
the
debatable
strategic
success
and
the
operational
failure
of
the
descent
on
Rochefort
William
Pitt
who
saw
purpose
in
this
type
of
asymmetric
enterprise
prepared
to
continue
such
operations
86
An
army
was
assembled
under
the
command
of
Charles
Spencer
3rd
Duke
of
Marlborough
he
was
aided
by
Lord
George
Sackville
The
naval
squadron
and
transports
for
the
expedition
were
commanded
by
Richard
Howe
The
army
landed
on
5
June
1758
at
Cancalle
Bay
proceeded
to
St
Malo
and
finding
that
it
would
take
prolonged
siege
to
capture
it
instead
attacked
the
nearby
port
of
St
Servan
It
burned
shipping
in
the
harbor
roughly
80
French
privateers
and
merchantmen
as
well
as
four
warships
which
were
under
construction
87
The
force
then
re
embarked
under
threat
of
the
arrival
of
French
relief
forces
An
attack
on
Havre
de
Grace
was
called
off
and
the
fleet
sailed
on
to
Cherbourg
the
weather
being
bad
and
provisions
low
that
too
was
abandoned
and
the
expedition
returned
having
damaged
French
privateering
and
provided
further
strategic
demonstration
against
the
French
coast
Pitt
now
prepared
to
send
troops
into
Germany
and
both
Marlborough
and
Sackville
disgusted
by
what
they
perceived
as
the
futility
of
the
descents
obtained
commissions
in
that
army
The
elderly
General
Bligh
was
appointed
to
command
a
new
descent
escorted
by
Howe
The
campaign
began
propitiously
with
the
Raid
on
Cherbourg
Covered
by
naval
bombardment
the
army
drove
off
the
French
force
detailed
to
oppose
their
landing
captured
Cherbourg
and
destroyed
its
fortifications
docks
and
shipping
The
troops
were
reembarked
and
moved
to
the
Bay
of
St
Lunaire
in
Brittany
where
on
3
September
they
were
landed
to
operate
against
St
Malo
however
this
action
proved
impractical
Worsening
weather
forced
the
two
armies
to
separate
the
ships
sailed
for
the
safer
anchorage
of
St
Cast
while
the
army
proceeded
overland
The
tardiness
of
Bligh
in
moving
his
forces
allowed
a
French
force
of
10
000
from
Brest
to
catch
up
with
him
and
open
fire
on
the
reembarkation

During
the
war
the
Seven
Nations
of
The
Iroquois
Confederacy
were
allied
with
the
French
These
were
Native
Americans
of
the
Laurentian
valley
the
Algonquin
the
Abenaki
the
Huron
and
others
Although
the
Algonquin
tribes
and
the
Seven
Nations
were
not
directly
concerned
with
the
fate
of
the
Ohio
River
Valley
they
had
been
victims
of
the
Iroquois
Confederation
which
included
the
Seneca
Mohawk
Oneida
Onondaga
Cayuga
and
Tuscarora
tribes
The
Iroquois
had
encroached
on
Algonquin
territory
and
pushed
the
Algonquins
west
beyond
Lake
Michigan
88
Therefore
the
Algonquin
and
the
Seven
Nations
were
interested
in
fighting
against
the
Iroquois
Throughout
New
England
New
York
and
the
North
west
Native
American
tribes
formed
differing
alliances
with
the
major
belligerents
The
Iroquois
dominant
in
what
is
now
Upstate
New
York
sided
with
the
British
but
did
not
play
a
large
role
in
the
war
In
1756
and
1757
the
French
captured
forts
Oswego
89
and
William
Henry
from
the
British
90
The
latter
victory
was
marred
when
France
s
native
allies
broke
the
terms
of
capitulation
and
attacked
the
retreating
British
column
which
was
under
French
guard
slaughtering
and
scalping
soldiers
and
taking
captive
many
men
women
and
children
while
the
French
refused
to
protect
their
captives

in

also
successfully
defended
the
key
Fortress
of
Louisbourg
on
Cape

by
the
French
securing

approaches
to

92
British
Prime
Minister
William
Pitt
s
focus
on
the
colonies
for
the
1758
campaign
paid
off
with
the
taking
of
Louisbourg
after
French
reinforcements
were
blocked
by
British
naval
victory
in
the
Battle
of
Cartagena
and
in
the
successful
capture
of
Fort
Duquesne
93
and
Fort
Frontenac
94
The
British
also
continued
the
process
of
deporting
the
Acadian
population
with
a
wave
of
major
operations
against
le
Saint
Jean
present
day
Prince
Edward
Island
the
St
John
River
valley
and
the
Petitcodiac
River
valley
The
celebration
of
these
successes
was
dampened
by
their
embarrassing
defeat
in
the
Battle
of
Carillon
Ticonderoga
in
which
4
000
French
troops
repulsed
16
000
British
When
the
British
led
by
generals
James
Abercrombie
and
George
Howe
attacked
they
believed
that
the
French
led
by
general
Marquis
de
Montcalm
were
defended
only
by
a
small
abatis
which
could
be
taken
easily
given
the
British
force
s
significant
numerical
advantage
The
British
offensive
which
was
supposed
to
advance
in
tight
columns
and
overwhelm
the
French
defenders
fell
into
confusion
and
scattered
leaving
large
spaces
in
their
ranks
When
the
French
Chevalier
de
Levis
sent
1
000
soldiers
to
reinforce
Montcalm
s
struggling
troops
the
British
were
pinned
down
in
the
brush
by
intense
French
musket
fire
and
they
were
forced
to
retreat
All
of
Britain
s
campaigns
against
New
France
succeeded
in
1759
part
of
what
became
known
as
an
Annus
Mirabilis
Fort
Niagara
95
and
Fort
Carillon
96
on
8
July
1758
fell
to
sizable
British
forces
cutting
off
French
frontier
forts
further
west
Starting
in
June
1759
the
British
under
James
Wolfe
and
James
Murray
set
up
camp
on
the
Ile
d
Orleans
across
the
St
Lawrence
River
from
Quebec
enabling
them
to
commence
the
3
month
siege
that
ensued
The
French
under
the
Marquis
de
Montcalm
anticipated
a
British
assault
to
the
east
of
Quebec
so
he
ordered
his
soldiers
to
fortify
the
region
of
Beauport
On
July
31
the
British
attacked
with
4
000
soldiers
but
the
French
positioned
high
up
on
the
cliffs
overlooking
the
Montmorency
Falls
forced
the
British
forces
to
withdraw
to
the
Ile
D
Orleans
While
Wolfe
and
Murray
planned
a
second
offensive
British
rangers
raided
French
settlements
along
the
St
Lawrence
destroying
food
supplies
ammunition
and
other
goods
in
an
attempt
to
vanquish
the
French
through
starvation
On
13
September
1759
General
James
Wolfe
led
5
000
troops
up
a
goat
path
to
the
Plains
of
Abraham
1
mile
west
of
Quebec
City
He
had
positioned
his
army
between
Montcalm
s
forces
an
hour
s
march
to
the
east
and
Bougainville
s
regiments
to
the
west
which
could
be
mobilised
within
3
hours
Instead
of
waiting
for
a
coordinated
attack
with
Bougainville
Montcalm
attacked
immediately
When
his
3
500
troops
advanced
their
lines
became
scattered
in
a
disorderly
formation
Many
French
soldiers
fired
before
they
were
within
range
of
striking
the
British
Wolfe
organised
his
troops
in
two
lines
stretching
1
mile
across
the
Plains
of
Abraham
They
were
ordered
to
load
their
Brown
Bess
rifles
with
two
bullets
to
obtain
maximum
power
and
hold
their
fire
until
the
French
soldiers
came
within
40
paces
of
the
British
ranks
When
Montcalm
s
army
was
within
range
of
the
British
their
volley
was
powerful
and
nearly
all
bullets
hit
their
targets
devastating
the
French
ranks
The
French
fled
the
Plains
of
Abraham
in
a
state
of
utter
confusion
while
they
were
pursued
by
members
of
the
Scottish
Fraser
regiment
and
other
British
forces
Despite
being
cut
down
by
musket
fire
from
the
Canadiens
and
their
indigenous
allies
the
British
vastly
outnumbered
these
opponents
and
won
the
Battle
of
the
Plains
of
Abraham
97
General
Wolfe
was
mortally
wounded
in
the
chest
early
in
the
battle
so
the
command
fell
to
James
Murray
who
would
become
the
lieutenant
governor
of
Quebec
after
the
war
The
Marquis
de
Montcalm
was
also
severely
wounded
later
in
the
battle
and
died
the
following
day
The
French
Canadians
led
by
the
Chevalier
de
Levis
staged
a
counteroffensive
on
the
Plains
of
Abraham
in
the
spring
of
1760
with
initial
success
at
the
Battle
of
Sainte
Foy
98
but
they
were
unable
to
retake
Quebec
due
to
British
naval
superiority
following
the
Battle

Neuville
The
French
forces
retreated
to

superiority

the

Among

In
1762
towards
the
end
of

war
French
forces
attacked
St

If
successful
the
expedition
would

at

Treaty
of
Paris
1763
The
Anglo
French
hostilities
were
ended
in
1763
by
the
Treaty
of
Paris
which
involved
a
complex
series
of
land
exchanges
the
most
important
being
France
s
cession
to
Spain
of
Louisiana
and
to
Great
Britain
the
rest
of
New
France
except
for
the
islands
of
St
Pierre
and
Miquelon
Faced
with
the
choice
of
regaining
either
New
France
or
its
Caribbean
island
colonies
of
Guadeloupe
and
Martinique
France
chose
the
latter
to
retain
these
lucrative
sources
of
sugar
114
writing
off
New
France
as
an
unproductive
costly
territory
115
France
also
returned
Menorca

Spain
lost
control
of
Florida

it
received
from
the
French
the
le

and
all
of
the
former
French
holdings
west
of
the
Mississippi
River
The
exchanges
suited
the
British
as
well
as
their
own
Caribbean
islands
already
supplied
ample
sugar
and
with
the
acquisition
of

In

the
British
retained
the

but
returned
all
the

The
treaty
however
required
that
the
fortifications
of
these
settlements
be
destroyed
and
never
rebuilt
while
only
minimal

thus

and
the

of

to
the

as

31
December
1762
Frederick
who
had
considered
ceding
East
Prussia
to
Russia
if
Peter
III
helped
him
secure
Saxony
finally
insisted
on
excluding
Russia
in
fact
no
longer
a
belligerent
from
the
negotiations
At
the
same
time
he
refused
to
evacuate
Saxony
until
its
elector
had
renounced
any
claim
to
reparation
The
Austrians
wanted
at
least
to
retain
Glatz
disambiguation
needed
which
they
had
in
fact
reconquered
but
Frederick
would
not
allow
it
The
treaty
simply
restored
the
status
quo
of
1748
with
Silesia
and
Glatz
reverting
to
Frederick
and
Saxony
to
its
own
elector
The
only
concession
that
Prussia
made
to
Austria
was
to
consent
to
the
election
of
Archduke
Joseph
as
Holy
Roman
emperor
Austria
was
not
able
to
retake
Silesia
or
make
any
significant
territorial
gain
However
it
did
prevent
Prussia
from
invading
parts
of
Saxony
More
significantly
its
military
performance
proved
far
better
than
during
the
War
of
the
Austrian
Succession
and
seemed
to
vindicate
Maria
Theresa
s
administrative
and
military
reforms
Hence
Austria
s
prestige
was
restored
in
great
part
and
the
empire
secured
its
position
as
a
major
player
in
the
European
system
120
Also
by
promising
to
vote
for
Joseph
II
in
the
Imperial
elections
Frederick
II
accepted
the
Habsburg
preeminence
in
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
The
survival
of
Prussia
as
a
first
rate
power
and
the
enhanced
prestige
of
its
king
and
its
army
however
was
potentially
damaging
in
the
long
run
to
Austria
s
influence
in
Germany
Not
only
that
Austria
now
found
herself
estranged
with
the
new
developments
within
the
empire
itself
Beside
the
rise
of
Prussia
Augustus
III
although
ineffective
could
muster
an
army
not
only
from
Saxony
but
also
Poland
since
he
was
also
the
King
of
Poland
as
well
as
Elector
of
Saxony
Bavaria
s
growing
power
and
independence
was
also
apparent
as
it
asserted
more
control
on
the
deployment
of
its
army
and
managed
to
disengage
from
the
war
at
its
own
will
Most
importantly
with
the
now
belligerent
Hanover
united
personally
under
George
III
of
Great
Britain
It
amassed
a
considerable
power
and
even
brought
Britain
in
on
future
conflicts
This
power
dynamic
was
important
to
the
future
and
the
latter
conflicts
of
the
Reich
The
war
also
proved
that
Maria
Theresa
s
reforms
were
still
insufficient
to
compete
with
Prussia
unlike
its
enemy
the
Austrians
were
almost
bankrupt
at
the
end
of
war
Hence
she
dedicated
the
next
two
decades
to
the
consolidation
of
her
administration
Prussia
emerged
from
the
war
as
a
great
power
whose
importance
could
no
longer
be
challenged
Frederick
the
Great
s
personal
reputation
was
enormously
enhanced
as
his
debt
to
fortune
Russia
s
volte
face
after
Elizabeth
s
death
and
to
British
financial
support
were
soon
forgotten
while
the
memory
of
his
energy
and
his
military
genius
was
strenuously
kept
alive
119
Though
depicted
as
a
key
moment
in
Prussia
s
rise
to
greatness
the
war
weakened
Prussia
119
Prussia
s
lands
and
population
were
devastated
though
Frederick
s
extensive
agrarian
reforms
and
encouragement
of
immigration
soon
solved
both
these
problems
Unfortunately
for
Prussia
its
army
had
taken
heavy
losses
particularly
the
officer
corps
and
in
the
war
s
aftermath
Frederick
could
not
afford
to
rebuild
the
Prussian
Army
to
what
it
was
before
the
war
119
In
the
War
of
the
Bavarian
Succession
the
Prussians
fought
poorly
despite
being
led
by
Frederick
in
person
119
During
the
war
with
France
in
1792
1795
the
Prussian
Army
did
not
fare
well
against
revolutionary
France
and
in
1806
the
Prussians
were
annihilated
by
the
French
at
the
Battle
of
Jena
119
It
was
only
after
1806
when
Prussian
government
brought
in
reforms
to
recover
from
the
disaster
of
Jena
that
Prussia
s
rise
to
greatness
later
in
the
19th
century
was
realized
119
However
none
of
this
had
happened
yet
and
after
1763
various
nations
all
sent
officers
to
Prussia
to
learn
the
secrets
of
Prussia
s
military
power
119
After
the
Seven
Years
War
Prussia
become
one
of
the
most
imitated
powers
in
Europe
119
Russia
on
the
other
hand
made
one
great
invisible
gain
from
the
war
the
elimination
of
French
influence
in
Poland
The
First
Partition
of
Poland
1772
was
to
be
a
Russo
Prussian
transaction
with
Austria
only
reluctantly
involved
and
with
France
simply
ignored
118
Though
the
war
had
ended
in
a
draw
the
performance
of
the
Imperial
Russian
Army
against
Prussia
had
improved
Russia
s
reputation
as
a
factor
in
European
politics
as
many
had
not
expected
the
Russians
to
hold
their
own
against
the
Prussians
in
campaigns
fought
on
Prussian
soil
119
The
American
historian
David
Stone
observed
that
Russian
soldiers
proved
capable
of
going
head
on
against
the
Prussians
inflicting
and
taking
one
bloody
volley
after
another
without
flinching
and
though
the
quality
of
Russian
generalship
was
quite
variable
the
Russians
were
never
decisively
defeated
once
in
the
war
121
The
Russians
defeated
the
Prussians
several
times
in
the
war
but
the
Russians
lacked
the
necessary
logistical
capability
to
follow
up
their
victories
with
lasting
gains
and
in
this
sense
the
salvation
of
the
House
of
Hohenzollern
was
due
more
to
Russian
weakness
with
respect
to
logistics
than
to
Prussian
strength
on
the
battlefield
122
Still
the
fact
that
the
Russians
proved
capable
of
defeating
in
battle
the
army
of
a
first
rate
European
power
on
its
own
soil
despite
the
often
indifferent
quality
of
their
generals
improved
Russia
s
standing
in
Europe
121
A
lasting
legacy
of
the
war
was
that
it
awakened
the
Russians
to
their
logistic
weaknesses
and
led
to
major
reforms
of
the
Imperial
Russian
Army
s
quartermaster
department
123
The
supply
system
that
allowed
the
Russians
to
advance
into
the
Balkans
during
the
war
with
the
Ottomans
in
1787
92
Marshal
Alexander
Suvorov
to
campaign
effectively
in
Italy
and
Switzerland
in
1798
99
and
for
the
Russians
to
fight
across
Germany
and
France
in
1813
14
to
take
Paris
was
created
directly
in
response
to
the
logistic
problems
experienced
by
the
Russians
in
the
Seven
Years
War
123
The
British
government
was
close
to
bankruptcy
and
Britain
now
faced
the
delicate
task
of
pacifying
its
new
French
Canadian
subjects
as
well
as
the
many
American
Indian
tribes
who
had
supported
France
In
1763
Pontiac
s
War
broke
out
as
a
group
of
Indian
tribes
in
the
Great
Lakes
region
and
the
Northwest
the
modern
American
Midwest
said
to
have
been
led
by
the
Ottawa
chief
Pontiac
whose
role
as
the
leader
of
the
confederation
seems
to
have
been
exaggerated
by
the
British
unhappy
with
the
eclipse
of
French
power
rebelled
against
British
rule
The
Indians
had
long
established
congenial
and
friendly
relations
with
the
French
fur
traders
and
the
Anglo
American
fur
traders
who
had
replaced
the
French
had
engaged
in
business
practices
that
enraged
the
Indians
who
complained
about
being
cheated
when
they
sold
their
furs
124
Moreover
the
Indians
feared
that
with
the
coming
of
British
rule
might
lead
to
white
settlers
displacing
them
off
their
land
whereas
it
was
known
that
the
French
had
only
come
as
fur
traders
124
Pontiac
s
War
was
a
major
conflict
in
which
the
British
temporarily
lost
control
of
the
Great
Lakes
Northwest
regions
to
the
Indians
125
By
the
middle
of
1763
the
only
forts
the
British
held
in
the
region
were
Fort
Detroit
modern
Detroit
Michigan
Fort
Niagara
modern
Youngstown
New
York
and
Fort
Pitt
modern
Pittsburgh
Pennsylvania
with
the
rest
all
being
lost
to
the
Indians
126
It
was
only
with
the
British
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Bushy
Run
that
prevented
a
complete
collapse
of
British
power
in
the
Great
Lakes
region
127
King
George
III
s
Proclamation
of
1763
which
forbade
white
settlement
beyond
the
crest
of
the
Appalachians
was
intended
to
appease
the
Indians
but
led
to
considerable
outrage
in
the
Thirteen
Colonies
whose
inhabitants
were
eager
to
acquire
native
lands
The
Quebec
Act
of
1774
similarly
intended
to
win
over
the
loyalty
of
French
Canadians
also
spurred
resentment
among
American
colonists
128
The
act
protected
Catholic
religion
and
French
language
which
enraged
the
Americans
but
the
Qu
b
cois
remained
loyal
to
the
British
Crown
during
the
American
Revolution
and
did
not
rebel
The
war
also
brought
to
an
end
the
Old
System
of
alliances
in
Europe
129
In
the
years
after
the
war
under
the
direction
of
Lord
Sandwich
the
British
attempted
to
re
establish
this
system
But
after
her
surprising
grand
success
against
a
coalition
of
great
powers
European
states
such
as
Austria
The
Dutch
Republic
Sweden
Denmark
Norway
Ottoman
Empire
and
Russia
now
saw
Britain
as
a
greater
threat
than
France
and
did
not
join
them
while
the
Prussians
were
angered
by
what
they
considered
a
British
betrayal
in
1762
Consequently
when
the
American
War
of
Independence
turned
into
a
global
war
between
1778
83
Britain
found
itself
opposed
by
a
strong
coalition
of
European
powers
and
lacking
any
substantial
ally

set
against
the
Seven

War
This
is
a
quote
about
the
war
from
the
novel
It
would
require
a
greater
philosopher
and
historian
than
I
am
to
explain
the
causes
of
the
famous
Seven
Years
War
in
which
Europe
was
engaged
and
indeed
its
origin
has
always
appeared
to
me
to
be
so
complicated
and
the
books
written
about
it
so
amazingly
hard
to
understand
that
I
have
seldom
been
much
wiser
at
the
end
of
a
chapter
than
at
the
beginning
and
so
shall
not
trouble
my
reader
with
any
personal
disquisitions
concerning
the
matter

near
Brussels
and
educated
in
Mannheim
Charles
Theodore
was
the
Margrave
of
Bergen
op
Zoom
from
1728
onwards
He
then
succeeded
his
father
as
Count
Palatine
of
Sulzbach
in
1733
and
inherited
the
Electoral
Palatinate
and
the
duchies
of
J
lich
and
Berg
in
1742
with
the
death
of
Charles
III
Philip
Elector
Palatine
To
strengthen
the
union
of
all
lines
of
the
Wittelsbach
dynasty
Charles
III
Philip
had
organised
a
wedding
on
17
January
1742
when
his
granddaughter
Elizabeth
Augusta
was
married
to
Charles
Theodore
and
her
sister
Maria
Anna
to
the
Bavarian
prince
Clement
As
reigning
Prince
Elector
Palatine
Charles
Theodore
won
the
hearts
of
his
subjects
by
founding
an
academy
of
science
stocking
up
the
museums
collections
and
supporting
the
arts
When
Maximilian
III
Joseph
of
Bavaria
died
in
1777
Charles

became
also
Elector
and
Duke
of
Bavaria

Charles
Theodore
did
not
immediately
take
up
his
new
title
He
had
several
mistresses
and
many
illegitimate
children
However
these
people
could
inherit
neither
the
Electorate
of
Bavaria
nor
that
of
the
Palatine
Charles
Theodore
needed
territory
that
he
could
bequeath
to
his
illegitimate

of
resurrecting
the

On
3
January
1778
shortly
after
the
death
of
Max
Joseph
Charles
Theodore
signed
an
agreement
with
Emperor
Joseph
II
to
exchange
southern
Bavaria
for
part
of
the
Austrian
Netherlands
The
plan
was
strongly
opposed
by
Maria
Anna
Sophia
of
Saxony
the
widow
of
Max
Joseph
and
Charles
Theodore
s
cousin
Charles
II
August
Duke
of
Zweibr
cken
the
head
of
the
House
of
Palatinate
Birkenfeld
and
next
heir
of
Bavaria
and
the
Palatinate
They
were
supported
by
Frederick
II
of
Prussia
and
most
of
the
German
minor
states
The
ensuing
diplomatic
crisis
led
to
the
War
of
the
Bavarian
Succession
which
was
ended
by
the
Peace
of
Teschen
1779
Charles
Theodore
accepted
the
Bavarian
succession
but
agreed
that
his
illegitimate
descendants
could
not
inherit
Bavaria
2
Austria
acquired
the
Innviertel
a
part
of
Bavaria
in
the
basin
of
the
Inn
river
3
Charles
Theodore
had
only
one
son
with
his
wife
Countess
Elizabeth
Augusta
of
Sulzbach
who
died
a
day
after
birth
His
wife
died
in
1794
In
1795
he
married
Maria
Leopoldine
of
Austria
Este
Joseph
s
niece
but
they
had
no
children
A
second
proposal
to
exchange
Bavaria
for
the
Austrian
Netherlands
in
1784
also
failed
as
Frederick
II
of
Prussia
initiated
the
F
rstenbund
When
Charles
Theodore
died
Bavaria
and
the
Electorate
passed
to
his
cousin
Max
Joseph
Duke
of
Zweibr
cken
the
younger
brother
of
Charles
August
who
had
died
in
1795
In
1989
Marvin
E
Thomas
in
Karl
Theodor
and
the
Bavarian
Succession
1777
1778
argued
that
in
fact
Charles
Theodore
wanted
to
maintain
possession
of
his
new
territory
as
is
shown
in
his
diplomatic
correspondence
Thomas
is
the
only
scholar
to
produce
such
an
analysis
4
It
is
more
widely
understood
that
Charles
Theodore
continued
the
despotic
and
expensive
habits
he
had
developed
as
Elector
Palatine
Rule
as
elector
of
Bavaria
edit
Charles
Theodore
never
became
popular
as
a
ruler
in
Bavaria
according
to
his
critic
Lorenz
von
Westenrieder
He
attempted
without
success
to
exchange
the
ducal
lands
of
Bavaria
for
the
Austrian
Netherlands
and
a
royal
crown
and
he
never
managed
to
control
the
mounting
social
tensions
in
Bavaria
After
a
dispute
with
Munich
s
city
council
he
even
moved
the
electoral
residence
in
1788
to
Mannheim
but
returned
only
one
year
later
5
In
1785
he
appointed
the
American
Loyalist
exile
Benjamin
Thompson
as
his
aide
de
camp
and
chamberlain
Over
the
next
11
years
Thompson
reformed
the
army
and
many
aspects
of
the
state
rising
to
high
ministerial
rank
with
Charles
Theodore
s
backing
and
becoming
Count
von
Rumford
Charles
Theodore
is
also
known
for
disbanding
Adam
Weishaupt
s
order
of
the
Illuminati
in
1785
In
1794
the
armies
of
revolutionary
France
occupied
the
Duchy
of
J
lich
in
1795
they
invaded
the
Palatinate
and
in
1796
marched
towards
Bavaria
Charles
Theodore
begged
Francis
II
for
help
that
would
have
made
Bavaria
a
puppet
state
of
Austria
When
he
died
of
a
stroke
in
Munich
in
1799
the
population
in
Munich
celebrated
for
several
days
He
is
buried
in
the
crypt
of
the
Theatinerkirche
in
Munich
Despite
the
mutual
dislike
and
distrust
between
the
Duke
and
his
Bavarian
subjects
Charles
Theodore
left
a
distinctive
mark
on
the
city
of
Munich
it
was
during
his
reign
that
the
English
Garden
Munich
s
largest
park
was
created
and
the
city
s
old
fortifications
were
dismantled
to
make
place
for
a
modern
expanding
city
One
of
Munich
s
major
squares
Karlsplatz
is
named
after
Charles
Theodore
Munich
natives
however
seldom
use
that
name
calling
the
square
instead
Stachus
after
the
pub
Beim
Stachus
that
was
located
there
until
construction
work
for
Karlsplatz
began
One
of
the
main
reasons
for
is
that
Charles
Theodore
as
noted
above
never
enjoyed
the
popularity
in
Bavaria
that
he
enjoyed
in
the
Palatinate

Character
edit
Charles
Theodore
was
more
interested
in
arts
and
philosophy
than
in
politics
Historian
Thomas
Carlyle
referred
to
him
as
a
poor
idle
creature
of
purely
egoistical
ornamental
dilettante
nature
sunk
in
theatricals
bastard
children
and
the
like
much
praised
by
Voltaire
who
sometimes
used
to
visit
him
and
Collini
to
whom
he
Charles
Theodore
is
a
kind
master
6
The
French
foreign
minister
Charles
Gravier
comte
de
Vergennes
knew
him
and
described
his
foibles
even
more
succinctly
Although
by
nature
intelligent
he
has
never
succeeded
in
ruling
by
himself
he
has
always
been
governed
by
his
ministers
or
by
his
father
confessor
or
for
a
time
by
the
E
lectress
his
wife
This
conduct
has
increased
his
natural
weakness
and
apathy
to
such
a
degree
that
for
a
long
time
he
has
had
no
opinions
save
those
inspired
in
him
by
his
entourage
The
void
which
this
indolence
has
left
in
his
soul
is
filled
with
the
amusements
of
the
hunt
and
of
music
and
by
secret
liaisons
for
which
His
Electoral
Majesty
has
at
all
times
had
a
particular
penchant
7
In
the
course
of
his
career
Charles
Theodore
acquired
a
celebrated
secretary
when
the
Florentine
noble
Cosimo
Alessandro
Collini
1727
1806
who
had
been
Voltaire
s
secretary
accepted
his
patronage
and
remained
in
the
Palatine
8
Although
Charles
Theodore
certainly
wished
to
acquire
more
territory
he
had
only
natural
sons
thus
he
preferred
territory
that
he
could
dispose
of
through
his
testament
rather
than
territory
encumbered
by
a
legal
entailment
that
could
only
pass
to
a
legitimate
son
9
Cultural
legacy
edit
Charles
Theodore
was
a
great
lover
of
the
arts
including
drama
and
especially
music
His
Mannheim
court
orchestra
was
considered
one
of
the
finest
in
its
time
The
Mannheim
School
including
composer
Christian
Cannabich
and
conductor
Johann
Stamitz
did
groundbreaking
work
that
the
celebrated
Wiener
Klassik
would
later
draw
upon
Mozart
applied
for
a
position
with
the
Mannheim
orchestra
in
1777
but
was
turned
down
as
the
court
was
about
to
move
to
Munich
In
1780
Charles
Theodore
commissioned
Idomeneo
from
the
composer
Mozart
quotes
him
as
saying
No
music
has
ever
made
such
an
impression
on
me
It
is
magnificent
10
In
keeping
with
the
customs
of
the
time
an
Italian
opera
company
as
well
as
a
troupe
of
French
actors
were
employed
at
Mannheim
each
performing
in
their
respective
tongues
Later
the
Nationaltheater
national
theatre
was
established
one
of
the
first
theatres
in
Germany
to
exclusively
showcase
plays
in
the
native
tongue
most
notably
the
first
staging
of
Schiller
s
Die
R
uber
in
1782
In
the
visual
arts
a
massive
collection
of
plaster
casts
taken
from
celebrated
antique
works
was
assembled
at
Mannheim
The
preexisting
D
sseldorf
gallery
including
many
works
by
Rubens
was
first
transferred
to
Mannheim
then
to
Munich
where
it
was
later
incorporated
in
the
Alte
Pinakothek
While
none
of
the
Mannheim
painters
are
particularly
notable
today
with
the
possible
exception
of
Kobell
primarily
a
master
of
landscapes
the
elector
had
several
highly
talented
sculptors
at
his
disposal
among
them
Verschaffelt
Simon
Peter
Lamine
and
Konrad
Linck
Linck
also
distinguished
himself
as
a
designer
of
porcelain
figurines
at

Charles
Theodore
s
chief
architect
Nicolas
de
Pigage
was
charged
to
complete
the
Mannheim
Palace
design
the
Schlosstheater
and
the
gardens
at
Schwetzingen
Palace
including
numerous
pavilions
among
them
several
artificial
Roman
ruins
and
a
mosque
as
well
as
Benrath
palace
While
these
works
are
in
a
pure
contemporary
French
style
marked
by
the
transition
from
late
Baroque
to
early
classicism
some
of
the
other
architects
employed
by
Charles
Theodore
were
proponents
of
a
more
Italianate
style
This
mixture
of
influences
is
in
fact
typical
of
many
German
courts
of
the
period
Charles
Theodore
was
also
responsible
for
the
construction
of
the
Old
Bridge
in
Heidelberg
which
bears
his
name
as
the
Karl
Theodor
Br
cke

Benrath
D

at
Schwetzingen
Castle
Entrance
to
Schwetzingen
Castle
Charles
Theodore
liked
to
style
himself
as
a
prince
of
peace
in
contrast
to
other
princes
like
his
chief
political
opponent
the
great
warrior
Frederick
II
of
Prussia
Allegorically
Minerva
the
Roman
goddess
of
wisdom
and
protectress
of
the
arts
is
often
depicted
as
a
stand
in
for
the
elector
himself
This
self
view
is
best
summed
up
in
the
inscription
of
a
small
monument
at
Schwetzingen
A
field
of
war
and
death
of
Romans
and
Germans
has
been
discovered
through
the
unearthing
of
weapons
urns
and
bones
in
the
year
1765
To
the
arts
of
peace
which
are
the
sole
joys
of
his
life
the
elector
Charles
Theodore
has
dedicated
this
spot
excavated
to
the
height
of
seven
feet
and
had
this
monument
erected

1768

Burgraviate
of
Nuremberg
and
Imperial
City
of
Nuremberg
Old
fortifications
of
Nuremberg
Nuremberg
was
according
to
the
first
documentary
mention
of
the
city
in
1050
the
location
of
an
Imperial
castle
between
the
East
Franks
and
the
Bavarian
March
of
the
Nordgau
4
From
1050
to
1571
the
city
expanded
and
rose
dramatically
in
importance
due
to
its
location
on
key
trade
routes
King
Conrad
III
established
a
burgraviate
with
the
first
burgraves
coming
from
the
Austrian
House
of
Raab
but
with
the
extinction
of
their
male
line
around
1190
the
burgraviate
was
inherited
by
the
last
count
s
son
in
law
of
the
House
of
Hohenzollern
From
the
late
12th
century
to
the
Interregnum
1254
73
however
the
power
of
the
burgraves
diminished
as
the
Hohenstaufen
emperors
transferred
most
non
military
powers
to
a
castellan
with
the
city
administration
and
the
municipal
courts
handed
over
to
an
Imperial
mayor

from
1173

The
strained
relations
between
the
burgraves
and
the
castellan
with
gradual
transferral
of
powers
to
the
latter
in
the
late
14th
and
early
15th
centuries
finally
broke
out
into
open
enmity
which
greatly
influenced
the
history
of
the
city
5
The
Imperial
Castle
Nuremberg
is
often
referred
to
as
having
been
the
unofficial
capital
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
particularly
because
Imperial
Diet
Reichstag
and
courts
met
at
Nuremberg
Castle
The
Diets
of
Nuremberg
were
an
important
part
of
the
administrative
structure
of
the
empire
The
increasing
demand
of
the
royal
court
and
the
increasing
importance
of
the
city
attracted
increased
trade
and
commerce
to
Nuremberg
In
1219
Frederick
II
granted
the
Gro
en
Freiheitsbrief
Great
Letter
of
Freedom
including
town
rights
Imperial
immediacy
Reichsfreiheit
the
privilege
to
mint
coins
and
an
independent
customs
policy
almost
wholly
removing
the
city
from
the
purview
of
the
burgraves
4
5
Nuremberg
soon
became
with
Augsburg
one
of
the
two
great
trade
centers
on
the
route
from
Italy
to
Northern
Europe
In
1298
the
Jews
of
the
town
were
accused
of
having
desecrated
the
host
and

of
them
were
killed
in
one
of
the
many
Rintfleisch
Massacres
Behind
the
massacre
of
1298
was
also
the
desire
to
combine
the
northern
and
southern
parts
of
the
city
which
were
divided
by
the
Pegnitz
The
Jews
of
the
German
lands
suffered
many
massacres
during

years
In

Nuremberg
s
Jews
were
subjected
to

They
were
burned
at

Nuremberg
in

from
the
Nuremberg
Chronicle
The
largest
gains
for
Nuremberg
were
in
the
14th
century
including
Charles
IV
s
Golden
Bull
of
1356
naming
Nuremberg
as
the
city
where
newly
elected
kings
of
Germany
must
hold
their
first
Imperial
Diet
making
Nuremberg
one
of
the
three
most
important
cities
of
the
Empire

Charles
was
the
patron
of
the
Frauenkirche
built
between
1352
and
1362
the
architect
was
likely
Peter
Parler
where
the
Imperial
court
worshipped
during
its
stays
in
Nuremberg
The
royal
and
Imperial
connection
was
strengthened
when
Sigismund
of
Luxembourg
granted
the
Imperial
regalia
to
be
kept
permanently
in
Nuremberg
in
1423
where
they
remained
until
1796
when
the
advancing
French
troops
required
their
removal
to
Regensburg
and
thence
to
Vienna
4
In
1349
the
members
of
the
guilds
unsuccessfully
rebelled
against
the
patricians
in
the
Handwerkeraufstand
Craftsmen
s
Uprising
supported
by
merchants
and
some
councillors
leading
to
a
ban
on
any
self
organisation
of
the
artisans
in
the
city
abolishing
the
guilds
that
were
customary
elsewhere
in
Europe
the
unions
were
then
dissolved
and
the
oligarchs
remained
in
power
while
Nuremberg
was
a
free
city

Charles
IV
conferred
upon
the
city
the
right
to
conclude
alliances
independently
thereby
placing
it
upon
a
politically
equal
footing
with
the
princes
of
the
empire
5
Frequent
fights
took
place
with
the
burgraves
without
however
inflicting
lasting
damage
upon
the
city
After
the
castle
had
been
destroyed
by
fire
in
1420
during
a
feud
between
Frederick
IV
since
1417
margrave

Brandenburg
and
the
duke
of
Bavaria
Ingolstadt
the
ruins
and
the
forest
belonging
to
the
castle
were
purchased
by
the
city
1427
resulting
in
the
city
s
total
sovereignty
within
its
borders
Through
these
and
other
acquisitions
the
city
accumulated
considerable
territory
5
The
Hussite
Wars
recurrence
of
the
Black
Death
in

and
the

led
to

beginning
of
the
16th
century
siding
with
Albert
IV
Duke
of
Bavaria
Munich
in
the
Landshut

to
gain
substantial
territory

The
cultural
flowering
of
Nuremberg
in
the
15th
and
16th
centuries
made
it
the
centre
of
the
German
Renaissance
In
1525
Nuremberg
accepted
the
Protestant
Reformation
and
in
1532
the
religious
Peace
of
Nuremberg
by
which
the
Lutherans
gained
important
concessions
was
signed
there
5
During
the
1552
revolution
against
Charles
V
Nuremberg
tried
to
purchase
its
neutrality
but
the
city
was
attacked
without
a
declaration
of
war
and
was
forced
into
a
disadvantageous
peace
5
At
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
the
possessions
of
the
Protestants
were
confirmed
by
the
Emperor
their
religious
privileges
extended
and
their
independence
from
the
Bishop
of
Bamberg
affirmed
while
the
1520s
secularisation
of
the
monasteries
was
also
approved

The
state
of
affairs
in
the
early
16th
century
increased
trade
routes
elsewhere
and
the
ossification
of
the
social
hierarchy
and
legal
structures
contributed
to
the
decline
in
trade
5
Frequent
quartering
of
Imperial
Swedish
and
League
soldiers
the
financial
costs
of
the
war
and
the
cessation
of
trade
caused
irreparable
damage
to
the
city
and
a
near
halving
of
the
population
5
In
1632
the
city
occupied
by
the
forces
of
Gustavus
Adolphus
of
Sweden
was
besieged
by
the
army
of
Imperial
general
Albrecht
von
Wallenstein
The
city
declined
after
the
war
and
recovered
its
importance
only
in
the
19th
century
when
it
grew
as
an
industrial
centre
Even
after
the
Thirty
Years
War
however
there
was
a
late
flowering
of
architecture
and
culture
secular
Baroque
architecture
is
exemplified
in
the
layout
of
the
civic
gardens
built
outside
the
city
walls
and
in
the
Protestant
city
s
rebuilding
of
the
Egidienkirche
destroyed
by
fire
at
the
beginning
of
the
18th
century
considered
a
significant
contribution
to
the
baroque
church
architecture
of
Middle
Franconia
4
After
the
Thirty
Years
War
Nuremberg
attempted
to
remain
detached
from
external
affairs
but
contributions
were
demanded
for
the
War
of
the
Austrian
Succession
and
the
Seven
Years
War
and
restrictions
of
imports
and
exports
deprived
the
city
of
many
markets
for
its
manufactures
5
The
Bavarian
elector
Charles
Theodore
appropriated
part
of
the
land
obtained
by
the
city
during
the
Landshut
War
of
Succession
to
which
Bavaria
had
maintained
its
claim
Prussia
also
claimed
part
of
the
territory
Realising
its
weakness
the
city
asked
to
be
incorporated
into
Prussia
but
Frederick
William
II
refused
fearing
to
offend
Austria
Russia
and
France
5
At
the
Imperial
diet
in
1803
the
independence
of
Nuremberg
was
affirmed
but
on
the
signing
of
the
Confederation
of
the
Rhine
on
12
July
1806
it
was
agreed
to
hand
the
city
over
to
Bavaria
from
8

with
Bavaria
guaranteeing
the
amortisation

to
refrain
from
further
discrimination

Nuremberg
rally
1935
Nuremberg
held
great
significance
during
the
Nazi
Germany
era
Because
of
the
city
s
relevance
to
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
and
its
position
in
the
centre
of
Germany
the
Nazi
Party
chose
the
city
to
be
the
site
of
huge
Nazi
Party
conventions
the
Nuremberg
rallies
The
rallies
were
held
1927
1929
and
annually
1933
1938
in
Nuremberg
After
Adolf
Hitler
s
rise
to
power
in
1933
the
Nuremberg
rallies
became
huge
Nazi
propaganda
events
a
centre
of
Nazi
ideals
The
1934
rally
was
filmed
by
Leni
Riefenstahl
and
made
into
a
propaganda
film
called
Triumph
des
Willens
Triumph
of
the
Will
At
the
1935
rally
Hitler
specifically
ordered
the
Reichstag
to
convene
at
Nuremberg
to
pass
the
anti
Semitic
Nuremberg
Laws
which
revoked
German
citizenship
for
all
Jews
and
other
non
Aryans
A
number
of
premises
were
constructed
solely
for
these
assemblies
some
of
which
were
not
finished
Today
many
examples
of
Nazi
architecture
can
still
be
seen

followed
In
total
about
6
000
Nuremberg
residents
are
estimated
to
have
been
killed
in
air

Nuremberg
was
a
heavily
fortified
city
that
was
captured
in
a
fierce
battle
lasting
from
17
to
21
April
1945
by
the
U
S
3rd
Infantry
Division
42nd

Division
and
45th
Infantry
Division
which
fought
house

house
and
street
by
street
against
determined
German
resistance
causing
further
urban
devastation
to
the
already
bombed
and
shelled
buildings

Despite
this
intense
degree
of
destruction
the
city
was
rebuilt
after

and
was
to
some
extent
restored
to
its
pre
war
appearance
including
the
reconstruction
of
some
of

However
over
half

Nuremberg
trials
Defendants
in
the
dock
at
the
Nuremberg
trials
Between
1945
and
1946
German
officials
involved
in
war
crimes
and
crimes
against
humanity
were
brought
before
an
international
tribunal
in
the
Nuremberg
trials
The
Soviet
Union
had
wanted
these
trials
to
take
place
in
Berlin
However
Nuremberg
was
chosen
as
the
site
for
the
trials
for
specific
reasons
The
city
had
been
the
location
of
the
Nazi
Party
s
Nuremberg
rallies
and
the
laws
stripping
Jews
of
their
citizenship
were
passed
there
There
was
symbolic
value
in
making
it
the
place
of
Nazi
demise
The
Palace
of
Justice
was
spacious
and
largely
undamaged
one
of
the
few
that
had
remained
largely
intact
despite
extensive
Allied
bombing
of
Germany
The
already
large
courtroom
was
reasonably
easily
expanded
by
the
removal
of
the
wall
at
the
end
opposite
the
bench
thereby
incorporating
the
adjoining
room
A
large
prison
was
also
part
of
the
complex
As
a
compromise
it
was
agreed
that
Berlin
would
become
the
permanent
seat
of
the
International
Military
Tribunal
and
that
the
first
trial
several
were
planned
would
take
place
in
Nuremberg
Due
to
the
Cold
War
subsequent
trials
never
took
place
The
same
courtroom
in
Nuremberg
was
the
venue
of
the
Nuremberg
Military
Tribunals
organized
by
the
United
States
as
occupying
power
in
the

He

the

Pleasure

he
is
seen
as
the
antithesis
to
his
predecessor
Frederick

Under
his
reign
Prussia
was
weakened
internally
and
externally
and
he
failed
to
deal
adequately
with
the
challenges
to
the
existing
order
posed
by
the
French
Revolution
His
religious
policies
were
directed
against
the
Enlightenment
and
aimed
at
restoring
a
traditional
Protestantism
However
he
was
a
patron
of
the
arts
and
responsible
for
the
construction
of
some
notable
buildings
among
them
the

in

a
woman
of
strong
intellect
and

ambition

when
she
was
still
in

Frederick

before
the
corpulence
of

patronage
and
his

had
a
Europe
wide
reputation
He
also
was
a
talented
cellist
1
But
an
artistic
temperament
was
hardly
what
was
required
of
a
king
of
Prussia
on
the
eve
of
the
French
Revolution
and
Frederick
the
Great
who
had
employed
him
in
various
services
notably
in
an
abortive
confidential
mission
to
the
court
of
Russia
in
1780
openly
expressed
his
misgivings
as
to
the
character
of
the
prince
and
his
surroundings
For
his
part
Frederick
William
who
had
never
been
properly
introduced
to
diplomacy
and
the
business
of
rulership
resented
his
uncle
for
not
taking
him
seriously
1
Reign
edit
The
misgivings
of
Frederick
II
appear
justified
in
retrospect
Frederick
William
s
accession
to
the
throne
17
August
1786
was
indeed
followed
by
a
series
of
measures
for
lightening
the
burdens
of
the
people
reforming
the
oppressive
French
system
of
tax
collecting
introduced
by
Frederick
and
encouraging
trade
by
the
diminution
of
customs
dues
and
the
making
of
roads
and
canals
This
gave
the
new
king
much
popularity
with
the
masses
the
educated
classes
were
pleased
by
his
removal
of
Frederick
s
ban
on
the
German
language
with
the
admission
of
German
writers
to
the
Prussian
Academy
and
by
the
active
encouragement
given
to
schools
and
universities
Frederick
William
also
terminated
his
predecessor
s
state
monopolies
for
coffee
and
tobacco
2
and
the
sugar
monopoly
3
However
under
his
reign
the
codification
known
as
Allgemeines
Preu
isches
Landrecht
initiated
by
Frederick
II
continued
and
was
completed
in
1794
4
Mysticism
and
religious
policies
edit
In
1781
Frederick
William
then
prince
of
Prussia
inclined
to
mysticism
had
joined
the
Rosicrucians
and
had
fallen
under
the
influence
of
Johann
Christoph
von
W
llner
and
Johann
Rudolf
von
Bischoffwerder
On
26
August
1786
W
llner
was
appointed
privy
councillor
for
finance
Geheimer
Oberfinanzrath
and
on
2
October
1786
was
ennobled
Though
not
in
name
he
in
fact
became
prime
minister
in
all
internal
affairs
it
was
he
who
decided
and
the
fiscal
and
economic
reforms
of
the
new
reign
were
the
application
of
his
theories
Bischoffswerder
too
still
a
simple
major
was
called
into
the
king
s
counsels
by
1789
he
was
already
an
adjutant
general
The
opposition
to
W
llner
was
indeed
at
the
outset
strong
enough
to
prevent
his
being
entrusted
with
the
department
of
religion
but
this
too
in
time
was
overcome
and
on
3
July
1788
he
was
appointed
active
privy
councillor
of
state
and
of
justice
and
head
of
the
spiritual
department
for
Lutheran
and
Catholic
affairs
From
this
position
W
llner
pursued
long
lasting
reforms
concerning
religion
in
the
Prussian
state
The
king
proved
eager
to
aid
W
llner
s
crusade
On
9
July
1788
the
famous
religious
edict
was
issued
which
forbade
Evangelical
ministers
from
teaching
anything
not
contained
in
the
letter
of
their
official
books
proclaimed
the
necessity
of
protecting
the
Christian
religion
against
the
enlighteners
Aufkl
rer
and
placed
educational
establishments
under
the
supervision
of
the
orthodox
clergy
On
18
December
1788
a
new
censorship
law
was
issued
to
secure
the
orthodoxy
of
all
published
books
This
forced
major
Berlin
journals
like
Christoph
Friedrich
Nicolai
s
Allgemeine
Deutsche
Bibliothek
and
Johann
Erich
Biester
s
Berliner
Monatsschrift
to
publish
only
outside
the
Prussian
borders
Moreover
people
like
Immanuel
Kant
were
forbidden
to
speak
in
public
on
the
topic
of
religion
3
Finally
in
1791
a
Protestant
commission
was
established
at
Berlin
Immediate
Examinationscommission
to
watch
over
all
ecclesiastical
and
scholastic
appointments
Although
W
llner
s
religious
edict
had
many
critics
it
was
an
important
measure
which
in
fact
proved
an
important
stabilizing
factor
for
the
Prussian
state
Aimed
at
protecting
the
multi
confessional
rights
enshrined
in
the
1648
Peace
of
Westphalia
the
provisions
of
W
llner
s
edict
were
intended
to
safeguard
against
religious
strife
by
imposing
a
system
of
state
sponsored
limits
5
The
edict
was
also
a
notable
step
forward
regarding
the
rights
of
Jews
Mennonites
and
Herrnhut
brethren
who
now
received
full
state
protection
5
Given
the
confessional
divides
within
Prussian
society
primarily
between
Calvinists
and
Lutherans
but
increasingly
Catholics
as
well
such
a
policy
was
important
for
maintaining
a
stable
civil
society
In
his
zeal
for
establishing
Prussia
as
a
paragon
of
stable
Christian
statehood
Frederick
William
outstripped
his
minister
he
even
blamed
W
llner
s
idleness
and
vanity
for
the
inevitable
failure
of
the
attempt
to
regulate
opinion
from
above
and
in
1794
deprived
him
of
one
of
his
secular
offices
in
order
that
he
might
have
more
time
to
devote
himself
to
the
things
of
God
in
edict
after
edict
the
king
continued
to
the
end
of
his
reign
to
make
regulations
in
order
to
maintain
in
his
states
a
true
and
active
Christianity
as
the
path
to
genuine
fear
of
God
Foreign
policies
edit
But
far
more
fateful
for
Prussia
was
the
king
s
attitude
towards
the
army
and
foreign
policy
The
army
was
the
very
foundation
of
the
Prussian
state
a
truth
which
both
Frederick
William
I
and
Frederick
the
Great
had
fully
realised
the
army
had
been
their
first
care
and
its
efficiency
had
been
maintained
by
their
constant
personal
supervision
Frederick
William
who
had
no
taste
for
military
matters
put
his
authority
as
Warlord
Kriegsherr
into
commission
under
a
supreme
college
of
war
Oberkriegs
Collegium
under
the
Duke
of
Brunswick
and
General
Wichard
Joachim
Heinrich
von
M
llendorf
It
was
the
beginning
of
the
process
that
ended
in
1806
at
the
disastrous
Battle
of
Jena
Although
the
Prussian
army
reached
its
highest
peacetime
level
of
manpower
under
Frederick
William
II
189
000
infantry
and
48
000
cavalry
under
his
reign
the
Prussian
state
treasury
incurred
a
substantial
debt
and
the
quality
of
the
troops
training
deteriorated
4
Under
the
circumstances
Frederick
William
s
interventions
in
European
affairs
were
of
little
benefit
to
Prussia
The
Dutch
campaign
of
1787
entered
into
for
purely
family
reasons
was
indeed
successful
but
Prussia
received
not
even
the
cost
of
her
intervention
An
attempt
to
intervene
in
the
war
of
Russia
and
Austria
against
the
Ottoman
Empire
failed
to
achieve
its
objective
Prussia
did
not
succeed
in
obtaining
any
concessions
of
territory
and
the
dismissal
of
minister
Hertzberg
5
July
1791
marked
the
final
abandonment
of
the
anti
Austrian
tradition
of
Frederick
the
Great
Meanwhile
the
French
Revolution
alarmed
the
ruling
monarchs
of
Europe
and
in
August
1791
Frederick
William
at
the
meeting
at
Pillnitz
Castle
agreed
with
Emperor
Leopold
II
to
join
in
supporting
the
cause
of
King
Louis
XVI
of
France
However
the
king
s
character
and
the
confusion
of
the
Prussian
finances
could
not
sustain
effective
action
in
this
regard
A
formal
alliance
was
indeed
signed
on
7
February
1792
and
Frederick
William
took
part
personally
in
the
campaigns
of
1792
and
1793
but
the
king
was
hampered
by
want
of
funds
and
his
counsels
were
distracted
by
the
affairs
of
a
deteriorating
Poland
which
promised
a
richer
booty
than
was
likely
to
be
gained
by
the
anti
revolutionary
crusade
into
France
A
subsidy
treaty
with
the
sea
powers
Great
Britain
and
the
Netherlands
signed
at
The
Hague
19
April
1794
filled
Prussia
s
coffers
but
at
the
cost
of
a
promise
to
supply
64
000
land
troops
to
the
coalition
The
insurrection
in
Poland
that
followed
the
partition
of
1793
and
the
threat
of
unilateral
intervention
by
Russia
drove
Frederick
William
into
the
separate
Treaty
of
Basel
with
the
French
Republic
5
April
1795
which
was
regarded
by
the
other
great
monarchies
as
a
betrayal
and
left
Prussia
morally
isolated
in
the
struggle
between
the
monarchical
principle
and
the
new
republican
creed
of
the
Revolution
Although
the
land
area
of
the
Prussian
state
reached
a
new
peak
under
his
rule
after
the
third
partition
of
Poland
in
1795
the
new
territories
included
parts
of
Poland
such
as
Warsaw
that
had
virtually
no
German
population
severely
straining
administrative
resources
due
to
various
pro
Polish
revolts

s

marriage
to
Elisabeth
Christine

his
first
cousin
had
ended
after
four
years
during
which
both
spouses
had
been
unfaithful
Their
uncle
Frederick

granted
a
divorce
reluctantly
as
he
was
more
fond
of
Elisabeth
than
of
Frederick
William

His
second
marriage
lasted
until
his
death
but
he
continued
his
relationship
with
Wilhelmine
Enke
In
1794
1797
he
had
a
castle
built

on

that

One
of
the
largest
empires
in
world
history
stretching
over
three
continents
the
Russian
Empire
was
surpassed
in
landmass
only
by
the
British
and
Mongol
empires
The
rise
of
the
Russian
Empire
happened
in
association
with
the
decline
of
neighboring
rival
powers
the
Swedish
Empire
the
Polish
Lithuanian
Commonwealth
Persia
and
the
Ottoman
Empire
It
played
a
major
role
in
1812
1814
in
defeating
Napoleon
s
ambitions
to
control
Europe
and
expanded
to
the
west
and
south
The
House
of
Romanov
ruled
the
Russian
Empire
from
1721
until
1762
and
its
German
descended
cadet
branch
the
House
of
Holstein
Gottorp
Romanov
ruled
from
1762
At
the
beginning
of
the
19th
century
the
Russian
Empire
extended
from
the
Arctic
Ocean
in
the
north
to
the
Black
Sea
in
the
south
from
the
Baltic
Sea
on
the
west
to
the
Pacific
Ocean
and
until
1867
into
Alaska
in
North
America
on
the
east
6
With
125
6
million
subjects
registered
by
the
1897
census
it
had
the
third
largest
population
in
the
world
at
the
time
after
Qing
China
and
India
Like
all
empires
it
included
a
large
disparity
in
terms
of
economics
ethnicity
and
religion
There
were
numerous
dissident
elements
who
launched
numerous
rebellions
and
assassination
attempts
they
were
closely
watched
by
the
secret
police
with
thousands
exiled
to
Siberia
Economically
the
empire
had
a
predominately
agricultural
base
with
low
productivity
on
large
estates
worked
by
serfs
until
they
were
freed
in
1861
The
economy
slowly
industrialized
with
the
help
of
foreign
investments
in
railways
and
factories
The
land
was
ruled
by
a
nobility
the
boyars
from
the
10th
through
the
17th
centuries
and
subsequently
by
an
emperor
Tsar
Ivan
III
1462
1505
laid
the
groundwork
for
the
empire
that
later
emerged
He
tripled
the
territory
of
his
state
ended
the
dominance
of
the
Golden
Horde
renovated
the
Moscow
Kremlin
and
laid
the
foundations
of
the
Russian
state
Tsar
Peter
the
Great
1682
1725
fought
numerous
wars
and
expanded
an
already
huge
empire
into
a
major
European
power
He
moved
the
capital
from
Moscow
to
the
new
model
city
of
St
Petersburg
and
led
a
cultural
revolution
that
replaced
some
of
the
traditionalist
and
medieval
social
and
political
mores
with
a
modern
scientific
Europe
oriented
and
rationalist
system
Catherine
the
Great
reigned
1762
1796
presided
over
a
golden
age
she
expanded
the
state
by
conquest
colonization
and
diplomacy
continuing
Peter
the
Great
s
policy
of
modernisation
along
West
European
lines
Tsar
Alexander
II
1855
1881
promoted
numerous
reforms
most
dramatically
the
emancipation
of
all
23
million
serfs
in
1861
His
policy
in
Eastern
Europe
involved
protecting
the
Orthodox
Christians
under
the
rule
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
That
connection
by
1914
led
to
Russia
s
entry
into
the
First
World
War
on
the
side
of
France
Britain
and
Serbia
against
the
German
Austrian
and
Ottoman
empires
The
Russian
Empire
functioned
as
an
absolute
monarchy
until
the
Revolution
of
1905
and
then
became
a
de
jure
constitutional
monarchy
The
empire
collapsed
during
the
February
Revolution
of
1917
largely
as
a
result
of
massive
failures
in
its
participation
in
the
First
World
War

of

Though
the
Empire
was
only
officially
proclaimed
by
Tsar
Peter
I
following
the
Treaty
of
Nystad
1721
some
historians
would
argue
that
it
was
truly
born
either
when
Ivan
III
of
Russia
conquered
Veliky
Novgorod
or
when
Ivan
the
Terrible
conquered
Khanate
of
Kazan
According
to
another
point
of
view
the
term
Tsardom
which
was
used
after
the
coronation
of
Ivan
IV
in
1547
was
already
a
contemporary
Russian
word

empire

Peter

just

Peter
the
Great
officially
renamed
the
Tsardom
of
Russia
to
the
Russian
Empire
in
1721
and
became
its
first
emperor
He
instituted
the
sweeping
reforms
and
oversaw
the
transformation
of
Russia
into
a
major
European
power
Peter
I
the
Great
1672
1725
played
a
major
role
in
introducing
Russia
to
the
European
state
system
However
this
vast
land
had
a
population
of
14
million
Grain
yields
trailed
behind
those
of
agriculture
in
the
West
8
compelling
nearly
the
entire
population
to
farm
Only
a
small
percentage
lived
in
towns
The
class
of
kholops
close
to
the
one
of
slavery
remained
a
major
institution
in
Russia
until
1723
when
Peter
I
converted
household
kholops
into
house
serfs
thus
including
them
in
poll
taxation
Russian
agricultural
kholops
were
formally
converted
into
serfs
earlier
in
1679
Peter
s
first
military
efforts
were
directed
against
the
Ottoman
Turks
His
attention
then
turned
to
the
North
Peter
still
lacked
a
secure
northern
seaport
except
at
Archangel
on
the
White
Sea
but
the
harbor
there
was
frozen
for
nine
months
a
year
Access
to
the
Baltic
was
blocked
by
Sweden
whose
territory
enclosed
it
on
three
sides
Peter
s
ambitions
for
a
window
to
the

secret
alliance
with

in

the
Polish
Lithuanian
Commonwealth
and
Denmark
against
Sweden
resulting
in
the
Great
Northern
War
The
war
ended
in
1721
when
an
exhausted
Sweden
asked
for
peace
with
Russia
Peter
acquired
four
provinces
situated
south
and
east
of
the
Gulf
of
Finland
The
coveted
access
to
the
sea
was
now
secured
There
he
built
Russia
s
new
capital
Saint
Petersburg
to
replace
Moscow
which
had
long
been
Russia
s
cultural
center
In
1722
he
turned
on
his
aspirations
as
first
Russian
monarch
to
increase
Russian
influence
in
the
Caucasus
and
the
Caspian
Sea
at
the
expense
of
the
at
that
time
weakened
Safavid
Persians
To
do
so
he
made
Astrakhan
the
centre
of
military
efforts
against
Persia
and
waged
the
first
full
scale
war
against
them
in

Peter
reorganized
his
government
based
on
the
latest
political
models
of
the
time
moulding
Russia
into
an
absolutist
state
He
replaced
the
old
boyar
Duma
council
of
nobles
with
a
nine
member
Senate
in
effect
a
supreme
council
of
state
The
countryside
was
also
divided
into
new
provinces
and
districts
Peter
told
the
Senate
that
its
mission
was
to
collect
tax
revenues
In
turn
tax
revenues
tripled
over
the
course
of
his
reign
As
part
of
the
government
reform
the
Orthodox
Church
was
partially
incorporated
into
the
country
s
administrative
structure
in
effect
making
it
a
tool
of
the
state
Peter
abolished
the
patriarchate
and
replaced
it
with
a
collective
body
the
Holy
Synod
led
by
a
government
official
Meanwhile
all
vestiges
of
local
self
government
were
removed
Peter
continued
and
intensified
his
predecessors
requirement
of
state
service
for
all
nobles
10
Peter
died
in
1725
leaving
an
unsettled
succession
After
a
short
reign
of
his
widow
Catherine
I
the
crown
passed
to
empress
Anna
who
slowed
down
the
reforms
and
led
a
successful
war
against
the
Ottoman
Empire
which
brought
a
significant
weakening
of
the
Ottoman
vassal
Crimean
Khanate
a
long
term
Russian
adversary
The
discontent
over
the
dominant
positions
of
Baltic
Germans
in
Russian
politics
brought
Peter
I
s
daughter
Elizabeth
on
the
Russian
throne
Elizabeth
supported
the
arts
architecture
and
the
sciences
for
example
with
the
foundation
of
the
Moscow
University
However
she
did
not
carry
out
significant
structural
reforms
Her
reign
which
lasted
nearly
20
years
is
also
known
for
her
involvement
in
the
Seven
Years
War
It
was
successful
for
Russia
militarily
but

politically

began
after

12
Empress
Catherine
the
Great
who
reigned
from
1762
to
1796
continued
the
empire
s
expansion
and
modernization
Considering
herself
an
enlightened
absolutist
she
played
a
key
role
in
the
Russian
Enlightenment
Catherine
the
Great
extended
Russian
political
control
over
the
lands
of
the
Polish
Lithuanian
Commonwealth
Her
actions
included
the
support
of
the
Targowica
Confederation
although
the
cost
of
her
campaigns
on
top
of
the
oppressive
social
system
that
required
serfs
to
spend
almost
all
of
their
time
laboring
on
their
owners
land
provoked
a
major
peasant
uprising
in
1773
after
Catherine
legalised
the
selling
of
serfs
separate
from
land
Inspired
by
a
Cossack
named
Pugachev
with
the
emphatic
cry
of
Hang
all
the
landlords
the
rebels
threatened
to
take
Moscow
before
they
were
ruthlessly
suppressed
Instead
of
the
traditional
punishment
of
being
drawn
and
quartered
Catherine
issued
secret
instructions
that
the
executioner
should
carry
the
sentence
out
quickly
and
with
a
minimum
of
suffering
as
part
of
her
effort
to
introduce
compassion
into
the
law
13
She
also
ordered
the
public
trial
of
Darya
Nikolayevna
Saltykova
a
member
of
the
highest
nobility
on
charges
of
torture
and
murder
These
gestures
of
compassion
garnered
Catherine
much
positive
attention
from
Europe
experiencing
the
Enlightenment
age
but
the
specter
of
revolution
and
disorder
continued
to
haunt
her
and
her
successors
In
order
to
ensure
continued
support
from
the
nobility
which
was
essential
to
the
survival
of
her
government
Catherine
was
obliged
to
strengthen
their
authority
and
power
at
the
expense
of
the
serfs
and
other
lower
classes
Nevertheless
Catherine
realized
that
serfdom
must
be
ended
going
so
far
in
her
Instruction
to
say
that
serfs
were
just
as
good
as
we
are
a
comment
the
nobility
received
with
disgust
Catherine
successfully
waged
war
against
the
Ottoman
Empire
and
advanced
Russia
s
southern
boundary
to
the
Black
Sea
Then
by
plotting
with
the
rulers
of
Austria
and
Prussia
she
incorporated
territories
of
the
Polish
Lithuanian
Commonwealth
during
the
Partitions
of
Poland
pushing
the
Russian
frontier
westward
into
Central
Europe
In
accordance
with
the
treaty
Russia
had
signed
with
the
Georgians
to
protect
them
against
any
new
invasion
of
their
Persian
suzerains
and
further
political
aspirations
Catherine
waged
a
new
war
against
Persia
in
1796
after
they
had
again
invaded
Georgia
and
established
rule
over
it
about
a
year
prior
and
expelled
the
newly
established
Russian
garrisons
in
the
Caucasus
By
the
time
of
her
death
in
1796
Catherine
s
expansionist
policy
had
turned
Russia
into
a
major
European
power
14
This
continued
with
Alexander
I
s
wresting
of
Finland
from
the
weakened
kingdom
of
Sweden
in
1809
and
of
Bessarabia
from

the

Although
the
Russian

would
play
a
leading
political
role
in
the
next
century
thanks
to
its
defeat
of
Napoleonic
France
its
retention
of
serfdom
precluded
economic
progress
of
any
significant
degree
As

began
to

creating
new
weaknesses
for
the

seeking
to
play
a
role
as
a

This
status
concealed
the

backwardness

who
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
was
confronted
with
an
uprising
The
background
of
this
revolt
lay
in
the
Napoleonic
Wars
when
a
number
of
well
educated
Russian
officers
travelled
in
Europe
in
the
course
of
military
campaigns
where
their
exposure
to
the
liberalism
of
Western
Europe
encouraged
them
to
seek
change
on
their
return
to
autocratic
Russia
The
result
was
the
Decembrist
revolt
December
1825
the
work
of
a
small
circle
of
liberal
nobles
and
army
officers
who
wanted
to
install
Nicholas
brother
as
a
constitutional
monarch
But
the
revolt
was
easily
crushed
leading
Nicholas
to
turn
away
from
the
modernization
program
begun
by
Peter
the
Great
and
champion
the
doctrine
of

Autocracy
and

for
the

The
question
of
Russia
s
direction
had
been
gaining
attention
ever
since
Peter
the
Great
s
program
of
modernization
Some
favored
imitating
Western
Europe
while
others
were
against
this
and
called
for
a
return
to
the
traditions
of
the
past
The
latter
path
was
advocated
by
Slavophiles
who
held
the
decadent
West
in
contempt
The
Slavophiles
were
opponents
of
bureaucracy
who
preferred
the
collectivism
of
the
medieval
Russian
obshchina
or
mir
over
the
individualism
of
the
West
25
More
extreme
social
doctrines
were

Russian
radicals

as

in

newly
acquired
Polish
territories
the
November
Uprising
in

and
the

Uprising
in

The
Russian
autocracy
gave
the
Polish
artisans
and
gentry
reason
to
rebel
in
1863
by
assailing
national
core
values
of
language
religion
culture
26
The
result
was
the
January
Uprising
a
massive
Polish
revolt
which
was
crushed
by
massive
force
France
Britain
and
Austria
tried
to
intervene
in
the
crisis
but
were
unable
to
do
so
The
Russian
patriotic
press
used
the
Polish
uprising
to
unify
the
Russian
nation
claiming
it
was
Russia
s
God
given
mission
to
save
Poland
and
the
world
27
Poland
was
punished
by
losing
its
distinctive
political
and

rights

on
its

peninsula
and

in

Since
playing
a
major
role
in
the
defeat
of

Russia
had
been
regarded
as
militarily
invincible
but
once
opposed
against
a
coalition
of
the
great
powers
of
Europe
the
reverses
it
suffered
on
land
and
sea
exposed
the
decay
and
weakness
of
Tsar
Nicholas
regime
When
Tsar
Alexander
II
ascended
the
throne
in
1855
desire
for
reform
was
widespread
A
growing
humanitarian
movement
attacked
serfdom
as
inefficient
In
1859
there
were
more
than
23
million
serfs
in
usually
poor
living
conditions
Alexander
II
decided
to
abolish
serfdom
from
above
with
ample
provision
for
the
landowners
rather
than
wait
for
it
to
be
abolished
from
below
in
a
revolutionary
way
that
would
hurt
the
landowners
33
The
emancipation
reform
of
1861
that
freed
the
serfs
was
the
single
most
important
event
in
19th
century
Russian
history
It
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
the
landed
aristocracy
s
monopoly
of
power
Further
reforms
of
1860s
included
socio
economic
reforms
which
would
clearify
the
position
of
the
Russian
government
in
the
field
of
property
rights
and
their
protection
34
Emancipation
brought
a
supply
of
free
labour
to
the
cities
industry
was
stimulated
and
the
middle
class
grew
in
number
and
influence
However
instead
of
receiving
their
lands
as
a
gift
the
freed
peasants
had
to
pay
a
special
tax
for
what
amounted
to
their
lifetime
to
the
government
which
in
turn
paid
the
landlords
a
generous
price
for
the
land
that
they
had
lost
In
numerous
cases
the
peasants
ended
up
with
the
smallest
amount
of
land
All
the
property
turned
over
to
the
peasants
was
owned
collectively
by
the
mir
the
village
community
which
divided
the
land
among
the
peasants
and
supervised
the
various
holdings
Although
serfdom
was
abolished
since
its
abolition
was
achieved
on
terms
unfavourable
to
the
peasants
revolutionary
tensions
were
not
abated
despite
Alexander
II
s
intentions
Revolutionaries
believed
that
the
newly
freed
serfs
were
merely
being
sold
into
wage
slavery
in
the
onset
of
the
industrial
revolution
and
that
the
bourgeoisie
had
effectively
replaced
landowners

clashed
in

From
1875

1877
the
Balkan
crisis
intensified
with
rebellions
against
Ottoman
rule
by
various
Slavic
nationalities
which
the
Ottoman
Turks
dominated
since
the
16th
century
This
was
seen
as
a
political
risk
in
Russia

similarly
suppressed
its
Muslims
in

Asia

Russian
nationalist
opinion
became
a
major
domestic
factor
in
its
support
for
liberating
Balkan
Christians
from
Ottoman
rule
and
making
Bulgaria
and

independent

March
1878
creating
an
enlarged
independent

As
a
result
Pan

were

legacy
of
bitterness
against
Austria

Germany
for
failing

by
his
son
Nicholas

who
was
committed
to
retaining
the
autocracy
that
his
father
had
left
him
Nicholas

proved
ineffective
as
a
ruler
and
in
the
end
his
dynasty
was
overthrown
by

41
The
Industrial
Revolution
began
to
show
significant
influence
in
Russia
but
the
country
remained
rural
and
poor
The
liberal
elements
among
industrial
capitalists
and
nobility
believed
in
peaceful
social
reform
and
a
constitutional
monarchy
forming
the
Constitutional
Democratic
Party
or
Kadets
42
On
the
left
the
Socialist
Revolutionary
Party
SRs
incorporated
the
Narodnik
tradition
and
advocated
the
distribution
of
land
among
those
who
actually
worked
it
the
peasants
Another
radical
group
was
the
Russian
Social
Democratic
Labour
Party
exponents
of
Marxism
in
Russia
The
Social
Democrats
differed
from
the
SRs
in
that
they
believed
a
revolution
must
rely
on
urban
workers
not
the
peasantry
43
In
1903
at
the
2nd
Congress
of
the
Russian
Social
Democratic
Labour
Party
in
London
the
party
split
into
two
wings
the
gradualist
Mensheviks
and
the
more
radical
Bolsheviks
The
Mensheviks
believed
that
the
Russian
working
class
was
insufficiently
developed
and
that
socialism
could
be
achieved
only
after
a
period
of
bourgeois
democratic
rule
They
thus
tended
to
ally
themselves
with
the
forces
of
bourgeois
liberalism
The
Bolsheviks
under
Vladimir
Lenin
supported
the
idea
of
forming
a
small
elite
of
professional
revolutionists
subject
to
strong
party
discipline
to
act
as
the
vanguard
of
the
proletariat
in

to
seize
power
by
force
44
Defeat
in
the
Russo
Japanese
War
1904
1905
was
a
major
blow
to
the
Tsarist
regime
and
further
increased
the
potential
for
unrest
In
January
1905
an
incident
known
as
Bloody
Sunday
occurred
when
Father
Georgy
Gapon
led
an
enormous
crowd
to
the
Winter
Palace
in
Saint
Petersburg
to
present
a
petition
to
the
Tsar
When
the
procession
reached
the
palace
soldiers
opened
fire
on
the
crowd
killing
hundreds
The
Russian
masses
were
so
furious
over
the
massacre
that
a
general
strike
was
declared
demanding
a
democratic
republic
This
marked
the
beginning
of
the
Revolution
of
1905
Soviets
councils
of
workers
appeared
in
most
cities
to
direct
revolutionary
activity
Russia
was
paralyzed
and
the
government
was
desperate

the

The

no

The
moderate
groups
were
satisfied

the

rejected

as
insufficient
and
tried
to

new
strikes

Siberia
and
the
Kyrgyz
steppes
from

it

Sea
the

To
the
South
it
had
the
Black

and
Caucasus

from
the
latter
by
the
Manych
River
depression
which
in
Post
Pliocene
times
connected
the
Sea
of
Azov
with
the
Caspian
The
western
boundary
was
purely
conventional
it
crossed
the
Kola
Peninsula
from
the
Varangerfjord
to
the
Gulf
of
Bothnia
Thence
it
ran
to
the
Curonian
Lagoon
in
the
southern
Baltic
Sea
and
thence
to
the
mouth
of
the
Danube
taking
a
great
circular
sweep
to
the
west
to
embrace
Poland
and
separating
Russia
from
Prussia
Austrian
Galicia
and
Romania
It
is
a
special
feature
of
Russia
that
it
has
few
free
outlets
to
the
open
sea
other
than
on
the
ice
bound
shores
of
the
Arctic
Ocean
The
deep
indentations
of
the
Gulfs
of
Bothnia
and
Finland
were
surrounded
by
what
is
ethnically
Finnish
territory
and
it
is
only
at
the
very
head
of
the
latter
gulf
that
the
Russians
had
taken
firm
foothold
by
erecting
their
capital
at
the
mouth
of
the
Neva
River
The
Gulf
of
Riga
and
the
Baltic
belong
also
to
territory
which
was
not
inhabited
by
Slavs
but
by
Baltic
and
Finnic
peoples
and
by
Germans
The
East
coast
of
the
Black
Sea
belonged
to
Transcaucasia
a
great
chain
of

separating
it
from
Russia
But
even
this
sheet
of
water
is
an
inland
sea
the
only
outlet
of
which
the
Bosphorus
was
in
foreign
hands
while
the
Caspian
an
immense
shallow
lake
mostly
bordered
by
deserts
possessed
more
importance
as

According
to
the
1st
article
of
the
Organic
law
the
Russian
Empire
was
one
indivisible
state
In
addition
the
26th
article
stated
that
With

Imperial
Russian
throne
are
indivisible
the
Kingdom
of
Poland
and
Grand
Principality
of
Finland
Relations
with
the
Grand
Principality
of
Finland
were
also
regulated
by
the
2nd
article
The
Grand
Principality
of
Finland
constituted
an
indivisible
part
of
the
Russian
state
in
its
internal
affairs
governed
by
special
regulations
at
the
base
of
special
laws
and
the
law
of
10
June
1910
Between
1744
and
1867
the
empire
also
controlled
Russian
America
With
the
exception
of
this
territory
modern
day
Alaska
the
Russian
Empire
was
a
contiguous
mass
of
land
spanning
Europe
and
Asia
In
this
it
differed
from
contemporary
colonial
style
empires
The
result
of
this
was
that
while
the
British
and
French
colonial
empires
declined
in
the
20th
century
the
Russian
Empire
kept
a
large
portion
of
its
territory
first
as
the
Soviet
Union
and
latter
as
part
of
present
day
Russia
as
well
as
the

the

at

controlled

conceded

Tsarist
absolutism
From
its
initial
creation
until
the
1905
Revolution
the
Russian
Empire
was
controlled
by
its
tsar
emperor
as
an
absolute
monarch
under
the
system
of
tsarist
autocracy
After
the
Revolution
of
1905
Russia
developed
a
new
type
of
government
which
became
difficult
to
categorize
In
the
Almanach
de
Gotha
for
1910
Russia
was
described
as
a
constitutional
monarchy
under
an
autocratic
tsar
This
contradiction
in
terms
demonstrated
the
difficulty
of
precisely
defining
the
system
essentially
transitional
and
meanwhile
sui
generis
established
in
the
Russian
Empire
after
October
1905
Before
this
date
the
fundamental
laws
of
Russia
described
the
power
of
the
Emperor
as
autocratic
and
unlimited
After
October
1905
while
the
imperial
style
was
still
Emperor
and
Autocrat
of
All
the
Russias
the
fundamental
laws
were
remodeled
by
removing
the
word
unlimited
While
the
emperor
retained
many
of
his
old
prerogatives
including
an
absolute
veto
over
all
legislation
he
equally
agreed
to
the
establishment
of
an
elected
parliament
without
whose
consent
no
laws
were
to
be
enacted
in
Russia
Not
that
the
regime
in
Russia
had
become
in
any
true
sense
constitutional
far
less
parliamentary
But
the
unlimited
autocracy
had
given
place
to
a
self
limited
autocracy
Whether
this
autocracy
was
to
be
permanently
limited
by
the
new
changes
or
only
at
the
continuing
discretion
of
the
autocrat
became
a
subject
of
heated
controversy
between
conflicting
parties
in
the
state
Provisionally
then
the
Russian
governmental
system
may
perhaps
be
best
defined
as
a
limited
monarchy
under

autocratic

Peter
the
Great

his
title
from
Tsar
in

when
he
was
declared
Emperor
of
all
Russia
While
later
rulers
kept
this
title
the
ruler
of
Russia
was
commonly
known
as
Tsar
or
Tsaritsa
until
the
fall
of
the
Empire
during
the
February
Revolution
of
1917
Prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
October
Manifesto
the
Emperor
ruled
as
an
absolute
monarch
subject
to
only
two
limitations
on
his
authority
both
of
which
were
intended
to
protect
the
existing
system
the
Emperor
and
his
consort
must
both
belong
to
the
Russian
Orthodox
Church
and
he
must
obey
the
laws
of
succession
Pauline
Laws
established
by
Paul
I
Beyond
this
the
power
of
the
Russian
Autocrat
was
virtually
limitless
On
17
October
1905
the
situation
changed
the
Emperor
voluntarily
limited
his
legislative
power
by
decreeing
that
no
measure
was
to
become
law
without
the
consent
of
the
Imperial
Duma
a
freely
elected
national
assembly
established
by
the
Organic
Law
issued
on
28
April
1906
However
the
Emperor
retained
the
right
to
disband
the
newly
established
Duma
and
he
exercised
this
right
more
than
once
He
also
retained
an
absolute
veto
over
all
legislation
and
only
he
could
initiate
any
changes
to
the
Organic
Law
itself
His
ministers
were
responsible
solely
to
him
and
not
to
the
Duma
or
any
other
authority
which
could
question
but
not
remove
them
Thus
while
the
Emperor
s
power
was
limited
in
scope
after
28
April
1906
it
still
remained

The
Duma
of

Duma
Gosudarstvennaya
Duma
which
formed
the
Lower
House
of
the
Russian
parliament
consisted
since
the
ukaz
of
2
June
1907
of
442
members
elected
by
an
exceedingly
complicated
process
The
membership
was
manipulated
as
to
secure
an
overwhelming
majority
of
the
wealthy
especially
the
landed
classes
and
also
for
the
representatives
of
the
Russian
peoples
at
the
expense
of
the
subject
nations
Each
province
of
the
Empire
except
Central
Asia
returned
a
certain
number
of
members
added
to
these
were
those
returned
by
several
large
cities
The
members
of
the
Duma
were
chosen
by
electoral
colleges
and
these
in
their
turn
were
elected
in
assemblies
of
the
three
classes
landed
proprietors
citizens
and
peasants
In
these
assemblies
the
wealthiest
proprietors
sat
in
person
while
the
lesser
proprietors
were
represented
by
delegates
The
urban
population
was
divided
into
two
categories
according
to
taxable
wealth
and
elected
delegates
directly
to
the
college
of
the
Governorates
The
peasants
were
represented
by
delegates
selected
by
the
regional
subdivisions
called
volosts
Workmen
were
treated
in
special
manner
with
every
industrial
concern
employing
fifty
hands
or
over
electing
one
or
more
delegates
to
the
electoral
college
In
the
college
itself
the
voting
for
the
Duma
was
by
secret
ballot
and
a
simple
majority
carried
the
day
Since
the
majority
consisted
of
conservative
elements
the
landowners
and
urban
delegates
the
progressives
had
little
chance
of
representation
at
all
save
for
the
curious
provision
that
one
member
at
least
in
each
government
was
to
be
chosen
from
each
of
the
five
classes
represented
in
the
college
That
the
Duma
had
any
radical
elements
was
mainly
due
to
the
peculiar
franchise
enjoyed
by
the
seven
largest
towns
Saint
Petersburg
Moscow
Kiev
Odessa
Riga
and
the
Polish
cities
of
Warsaw

These
elected
their
delegates
to
the
Duma
directly
and
though
their
votes
were
divided
on
the
basis
of
taxable
property
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
the
advantage
to

each
returned

Judicial
system
of
the
Russian
Empire
The
judicial
system
of
the
Russian
Empire
existed
from
the
mid
19th
century
was
established
by
the
tsar
emancipator
Alexander
II
by
the
statute
of
20
November
1864
Sudebny
Ustav
This
system
based
partly
on
English
partly
on
French
models
was
built
up
on
certain
broad
principles
the
separation
of
the
judicial
and
administrative
functions
the
independence
of
the
judges
and
courts
the
publicity
of
trials
and
oral
procedure
the
equality
of
all
classes
before
the
law
Moreover
a
democratic
element
was
introduced
by
the
adoption
of
the
jury
system
and
so
far
as
one
order
of
tribunal
was
concerned
the
election
of
judges
The
establishment
of
a
judicial
system
on
these
principles
constituted
a
major
change
in
the
conception
of
the
Russian
state
which
by
placing
the
administration
of
justice
outside
the
sphere
of
the
executive
power
ceased
to
be
a
despotism
This
fact
made
the
system
especially
obnoxious
to
the
bureaucracy
and
during
the
latter
years
of
Alexander
II
and
the
reign
of
Alexander
III
there
was
a
piecemeal
taking
back
of
what
had
been
given
It
was
reserved
for
the
third
Duma
after
the
1905
Revolution
to
begin
the
reversal
of
this
process

The
system
established
by
the
law
of
1864
was
significant
in
that
it
set
up
two
wholly
separate
orders
of
tribunals
each
having
their
own
courts
of
appeal
and
coming
in
contact
only
in
the
Senate
as
the
supreme
court
of
cassation
The
first
of
these
based
on
the
English
model
are
the
courts
of
the
elected
justices
of
the
peace
with
jurisdiction
over
petty
causes
whether
civil
or
criminal

each

an

The

provinces
Courland
Livonia
and
Estonia
were
incorporated
into
the
Russian
Empire
after
the
defeat
of
Sweden
in
the
Great
Northern
War
Under
the
Treaty
of
Nystad
of
1721
the
Baltic
German
nobility
retained
considerable
powers
of
self
government
and
numerous
privileges
in
matters
affecting
education
police
and
the
administration
of

justice
After
167
years
of

and

laws
were
declared
in
1888
and
1889
where
the
rights

justice
were
transferred
from

German

The
planning
and
building
of
the
railway
network
after
1860
had
far
reaching
effects
on
the
economy
culture
and
ordinary
life
of
Russia
The
central
authorities
and
the
imperial
elite
made
most
of
the
key
decisions
but
local
elites
set
up
a
demand
for
rail
linkages
Local
nobles
merchants
and
entrepreneurs
imagined
the
future
from
locality
mestnost
to
empire
to
promote
their
regional
interests
Often
they
had
to
compete
with
other
cities
By
envisioning
their
own
role
in
a
rail
network
they
came
to
understand
how
important
they
were
to
the
empire
s
economy

The
Russian

The

Railway
began
at

on

reached

served

The
serfdom
which
had

in

in
the
16th
century
and
became
enshrined
by
law
in
1649
was
abolished
in
1861
62
63
The
household
servants
or
dependents
attached
to
the
personal
service
were
merely
set
free
while
the
landed
peasants
received
their
houses
and
orchards
and
allotments
of
arable
land
These
allotments
were
given
over
to
the
rural
commune
mir
which
was
made
responsible
for
the
payment
of
taxes
for
the
allotments
For
these
allotments
the
peasants
had
to
pay
a
fixed
rent
which
could
be
fulfilled
by
personal
labour
The
allotments
could
be
redeemed
by
peasants
with
the
help
of
the
Crown
and
then
they
were
freed
from
all
obligations
to
the
landlord
The
Crown
paid
the
landlord
and
the
peasants
had
to
repay
the
Crown
for
forty
nine
years
at
6
interest
The
financial
redemption
to
the
landlord
was
not
calculated
on
the
value
of
the
allotments
but
was
considered
as
a
compensation
for
the
loss
of
the
compulsory
labour
of
the
serfs
Many
proprietors
contrived
to
curtail
the
allotments
which
the
peasants
had
occupied
under
serfdom
and
frequently
deprived
them
of
precisely
the
parts
of
which
they
were
most
in
need
pasture
lands
around
their
houses
The
result
was
to
compel
the
peasants
to

one

received

the

is

at
28
to

170

Land
must
thus
of
necessity
be
rented
from
the

The
aggregate
value
of

taxes
often
reached
185
to
275
of
the
normal

value
of

not
to
speak
of
taxes
for

on
chiefly
levied
from

The
areas

Every

more

the

in

three
quarters
of
the
men
and
one
third
of
the
women
quit
their
homes
and
wandered
throughout
Russia
in
search
of
labor
In
the
governments
of
the
Black
Earth
Area
the
state
of
matters
was
hardly
better
Many
peasants
took
gratuitous
allotments
whose
amount
was
about
one
eighth
of
the
normal
allotments

The
average
allotment
in

the
peasants
pay
5

The
state
peasants
were
better
off
but
still
they
were
emigrating
in
masses
It
was
only
in
the
steppe
governments
that
the
situation
was
more
hopeful
In
Ukraine
where
the
allotments
were
personal
the
mir
existing
only
among
state
peasants
the
state
of
affairs
does
not
differ
for
the
better
on
account
of
the
high
redemption
taxes
In
the
western
provinces
where
the
land
was
valued
cheaper
and
the
allotments
somewhat
increased
after
the
Polish
insurrection
the
general
situation
was
better
Finally
in
the
Baltic
provinces
nearly
all
the
land
belonged
to
the
German
landlords
who
either
farmed
the
land
themselves
with
hired
laborers
or
let
it
in
small
farms
Only
one
quarter
of
the
peasants
were
farmers
the
remainder
were
mere
laborers

Landowners
edit
The
situation
of
the
former
serf
proprietors
was
also
unsatisfactory
Accustomed
to
the
use
of
compulsory
labor
they
failed
to
adapt
to
the
new
conditions
The
millions
of
rubles
of
redemption
money
received
from
the
crown
was
spent
without
any
real
or
lasting
agricultural
improvements
having
been
effected
The
forests
were
sold
and
the
only
prosperous
landlords
were
those
who
exacted
rack
rents
for
the
land
without
which
the
peasants
could
not
live
upon
their
allotments
During
the
years
1861
to
1892
the
land
owned
by
the
nobles
decreased
30
or
from
210
000
000
to
150
000
000
acres
610
000
km2
during
the
following
four
years
an
additional
2
119
500
acres
8
577
km2
were
sold
and
since
then
the
sales
went
on
at
an
accelerated
rate
until
in
1903
alone
close
to
2
000
000
acres
8
000
km2
passed
out
of
their
hands
On
the
other
hand
since
1861
and
more
especially
since
1882
when
the
Peasant
Land
Bank
was
founded
for
making
advances
to
peasants
who
were
desirous
of
purchasing
land
the
former
serfs
or
rather
their
descendants
had
between
1883
and
1904
bought
about
19
500
000
acres
78
900
km2
from
their
former
masters
There
was
an
increase
of
wealth
among
the
few
but
along
with
this
a
general
impoverishment
of
the
mass
of
the
people
and
the
peculiar
institution
of
the
mir
framed
on
the
principle
of
community
of
ownership
and
occupation
of
the
land
the
effect
was
not
conducive
to
the
growth
of
individual
effort
In
November
1906
however
the
emperor
Nicholas
II
promulgated
a
provisional
order
permitting
the
peasants
to
become
freeholders
of
allotments
made
at
the
time
of
emancipation
all
redemption
dues
being
remitted
This
measure
which
was
endorsed
by
the
third
Duma
in
an
act
passed
on
21
December
1908
is
calculated
to
have
far
reaching
and
profound
effects
on
the
rural
economy
of
Russia
Thirteen
years
previously
the
government
had
endeavored
to
secure
greater
fixity
and
permanence
of
tenure
by
providing
that
at
least
twelve
years
must
elapse
between
every
two
redistributions
of
the
land
belonging
to
a
mir
amongst
those
entitled
to
share
in
it
The
order
of
November
1906
had
provided
that
the
various
strips
of
land
held
by
each
peasant
should
be
merged
into
a
single
holding
the
Duma
however
on
the
advice
of
the
government
left
this
to
the
future
as
an
ideal
that
could
only
gradually
be
realized

Censorship
was
heavy
handed
until
the
reign
of
Alexander
II
but
it
never
went
away
70
Newspapers
were
strictly
limited
in
what
they
could
publish
as
intellectuals
favored
literary
magazines
for
their
publishing
outlets
Fyodor
Dostoyevsky
for
example
ridiculed
the
St
Petersburg
newspapers
such
as
Golos
and
Peterburgskii
Listok
which
he
accused
of
publishing
trifles
and
distracting
readers
from
the
pressing
social
concerns
of
contemporary
Russia
through
their
obsession
with
spectacle
and
European
popular
culture

From
1860
to
1905
the
Russian
Empire
occupied
all
territories
of
the
present
day
Russian
Federation
with
the
exception
of
the
present
day
Kaliningrad
Oblast
Kuril
Islands
and
Tuva
In
1905
Russia
lost
Southern
Sakhalin
to
Japan
but
in
1914
the
Empire
established
a
protectorate
over
Tuva
An
ukaz
of
1879
gave
the
governors
the
right
to
report
secretly
on
the
qualifications
of
candidates
for
the
office
of
justice
of
the
peace
In
1889
Alexander
III
abolished
the
election
of
justices
of
the
peace
except
in
certain
large
towns
and
some
outlying
parts
of
the
Empire
and
greatly
restricted
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
The
confusion
of
the
judicial
and
administrative
functions
was
introduced
again
by
the
appointment
of
officials
as
judges
In
1909
the
third
Duma
restored
the
election
of
justices
of
the
peace
The
Lutheran
Church
was
the
dominant
faith
of
the
Baltic
Provinces
of
Ingria
and
of
the
Grand
Duchy
of
Finland

the
Renaissance
French
culture
flourished
and
a
global
colonial
empire
was
established
which
by
the
20th
century
would
be
the
second
largest
in
the
world
10
The
16th

was
dominated
by
religious
civil
wars
between
Catholics
and
Protestants
Huguenots
France
became
Europe
s
dominant
cultural
political
and
military
power
under
Louis

11
In
the
late
18th
century
the
French
Revolution
overthrew
the
absolute
monarchy
established
one
of
modern
history
s
earliest

of
the
Declaration
of
the
Rights
of
Man
and
of
the
Citizen
which

In
the
19th
century
Napoleon
took
power
and
established
the
First
French
Empire
whose
subsequent
Napoleonic
Wars
shaped
the
course
of
continental
Europe
Following
the
collapse
of
the
Empire
France
endured
a
tumultuous
succession
of
governments
culminating
with
the
establishment
of
the
French
Third
Republic
in
1870
France
was
a
major
participant
in
World
War
I
from
which
it
emerged
victorious
and
was
one
of
the
Allied
Powers
in
World

II
but
came
under
occupation
by
the
Axis
powers
in
1940
Following
liberation
in
1944
a
Fourth
Republic
was
established
and
later
dissolved
in
the
course
of
the
Algerian
War
The
Fifth
Republic
led
by
Charles
de

was
formed
in
1958
and
remains
to
this
day
Algeria
and
nearly
all
the
other
colonies
became
independent
in
the
1960s
and
typically
retained
close
economic
and
military
connections
with
France
France

Name
of
France
Originally
applied
to
the
whole
Frankish
Empire
the
name
France
comes
from
the
Latin
Francia
or
country
of
the
Franks
20
Modern
France
is
still
named
today
Francia
in
Italian
and
Spanish
Frankreich
in
German
and
Frankrijk
in
Dutch
all
of
which
have
the
same
historical
meaning
There
are
various
theories
as
to
the
origin
of
the
name
Frank
Following
the
precedents
of
Edward
Gibbon
and
Jacob
Grimm
21
the
name
of
the
Franks
has
been
linked
with
the
word
frank
free
in
English
22
It
has
been
suggested
that
the
meaning
of
free
was
adopted
because
after
the
conquest
of
Gaul
only
Franks
were
free
of
taxation
23
Another
theory
is
that
it
is
derived
from
the
Proto
Germanic
word
frankon
which
translates
as
javelin
or
lance
as
the
throwing
axe
of
the
Franks
was
known
as
a
francisca
24
However
it
has
been
determined
that
these
weapons
were
named
because
of
their
use
by
the
Franks
not
the
other
way
around

The

of
Gaul
emerged
at
that
time
it
corresponds
to
the
territories
of
Celtic
settlement
ranging
between
the
Rhine
the
Atlantic
Ocean
the
Pyrenees
and
the
Mediterranean
The
borders
of
modern
France
are
roughly
the
same
as
those
of
ancient
Gaul
which
was
inhabited
by
Celtic
Gauls
Gaul
was
then
a
prosperous
country
of
which
the
southernmost
part
was
heavily
subject
to
Greek
and
Roman
cultural
and
economic
influences
Around
390
BC
the
Gallic
chieftain
Brennus
and
his
troops
made
their
way
to
Italy
through
the
Alps
defeated
the
Romans
in
the
Battle
of
the
Allia
and
besieged
and
ransomed
Rome
The
Gallic
invasion
left
Rome
weakened
and
the
Gauls
continued
to
harass
the
region
until
345
BC
when
they
entered
into
a
formal
peace
treaty
with
Rome
But
the
Romans
and
the
Gauls
would
remain
adversaries
for
the
next
several
centuries
and
the
Gauls
would
continue
to
be
a
threat
in
Italia
Around
125
BC
the
south
of
Gaul
was
conquered
by
the
Romans
who
called
this
region
Provincia
Nostra
Our
Province
which
over
time
evolved
into
the
name
Provence
in
French
31
Julius
Caesar
conquered
the
remainder
of
Gaul
and
overcame

out
by

Vercingetorix
in

BC
32
Gaul
was
divided
by
Augustus
into
Roman
provinces
33
Many
cities
were
founded
during
the
Gallo
Roman
period
including
Lugdunum
present
day
Lyon
which
is
considered
the
capital
of
the
Gauls
33
These
cities
were
built
in
traditional
Roman
style
with
a
forum
a
theatre
a
circus
an
amphitheatre
and
thermal
baths
The
Gauls
mixed
with
Roman
settlers
and
eventually
adopted
Roman
culture
and
Roman
speech
Latin
from
which
the
French
language
evolved
The
Roman
polytheism
merged
with
the
Gallic
paganism
into
the
same
syncretism
From
the
250s
to
the
280s
AD
Roman
Gaul
suffered
a
serious
crisis
with
its
fortified
borders
being
attacked
on
several
occasions
by
barbarians
34
Nevertheless
the
situation
improved
in
the
first
half
of
the
4th
century
which
was
a
period
of
revival
and
prosperity
for
Roman
Gaul
35
In

the

Constantin

converted

Subsequently
Christians

Simultaneously
Celtic

of

As
a
result
the

peninsula
was
renamed

Celtic
culture
was

and

arose
in

The

from
whom
the
ancient

was
derived
originally
settled
the
north
part
of
Gaul
but
under
Clovis
I
conquered
most
of
the
other
kingdoms
in
northern
and
central
Gaul
In
498
Clovis
I
was
the
first
Germanic
conqueror
after
the
fall
of
the
Roman
Empire
to
convert
to
Catholic
Christianity
rather
than
Arianism
thus
France
was
given
the
title
Eldest

by
the
papacy
39
and
French
kings
would
be
called
the
Most

Rex
Christianissimus
The
Franks
embraced
the
Christian
Gallo
Roman
culture
and
ancient
Gaul
was
eventually
renamed
Francia
Land
of
the
Franks
The
Germanic
Franks
adopted
Romanic
languages
except
in
northern
Gaul
where
Roman
settlements
were
less
dense
and
where
Germanic
languages
emerged
Clovis
made
Paris
his
capital
and
established
the
Merovingian
dynasty
but
his
kingdom
would
not
survive
his
death
The
Franks
treated
land
purely
as
a
private
possession
and
divided
it
among
their
heirs
so
four
kingdoms
emerged
from
Clovis
s
Paris

approximated
the
area

and
was
the
precursor
to
modern
France
41
During
the
9th
and
10th
centuries
continually
threatened
by
Viking
invasions
France
became
a
very
decentralised
state
the
nobility
s
titles
and
lands
became
hereditary
and
the
authority
of
the
king
became
more
religious
than
secular
and
thus
was
less
effective
and
constantly
challenged
by
powerful
noblemen
Thus
was
established
feudalism
in
France
Over
time
some
of
the
king
s
vassals
would
grow
so
powerful
that
they
often
posed
a
threat
to
the
king
For
example
after
the
Battle
of
Hastings
in
1066
William
the
Conqueror
added
King
of
England
to
his
titles
becoming
both
the
vassal
to
as
Duke
of
Normandy
and
the
equal
of
as
king
of
England
the
king
of
France

42
His
descendants
the

the

and
the
House
of

progressively
unified
the
country
through
wars
and
dynastic
inheritance
into
the
Kingdom
of
France
which
was
fully
declared
in
1190
by
Philip
II
Augustus
The
French
nobility
played
a
prominent
role
in
most
Crusades
in
order
to
restore
Christian
access
to
the
Holy
Land
French
knights
made
up
the
bulk
of
the
steady
flow
of
reinforcements
throughout
the
two
hundred
year
span
of
the
Crusades
in
such
a
fashion
that
the
Arabs
uniformly
referred
to
the
crusaders
as
Franj
caring
little
whether
they
really
came
from
France
43
The
French
Crusaders
also
imported
the
French
language
into
the
Levant
making
French
the
base
of
the
lingua
franca
litt
Frankish
language
of
the
Crusader
states
43
French
knights
also
comprised
the
majority
in
both
the
Hospital
and
the
Temple
orders
The
latter
in
particular
held
numerous
properties
throughout
France
and
by
the
13th
century
were
the
principal
bankers
for
the
French
crown
until
Philip
IV
annihilated
the
order
in
1307
The
Albigensian
Crusade
was
launched
in
1209
to
eliminate
the
heretical
Cathars
in
the
southwestern
area
of
modern
day
France
In
the
end
the
Cathars
were
exterminated
and
the
autonomous
County
of
Toulouse
was
annexed
into
the
kingdom
of
France
44
Later
kings
expanded
their
domain
to
cover
over
half
of
modern
continental
France
including
most
of
the
north
centre
and
west
of
France
Meanwhile
the
royal
authority
became
more
and
more
assertive
centred
on
a
hierarchically
conceived
society
distinguishing
nobility
clergy
and
commoners
Charles
IV
the
Fair
died
without
an
heir
in
1328
45
Under
the
rules
of
the
Salic
law
the
crown
of
France
could
not
pass
to
a
woman
nor
could
the
line
of
kingship
pass
through
the
female
line
45
Accordingly
the
crown
passed
to
Philip
of
Valois
a
cousin
of
Charles
rather
than
through
the
female
line
to
Charles
nephew
Edward
who
would
soon
become
Edward
III
of
England
During
the
reign
of
Philip
of
Valois
the
French
monarchy
reached
the
height
of
its
medieval
power
45
Philip
s
seat
on
the
throne
was
contested
by
Edward
III
of
England
and
in
1337
on

During

minority
and
the

of

a
period
of
trouble
known
as
the
Fronde
occurred
in
France
which
was
at
that
time
at
war
with
Spain
This
rebellion
was
driven
by
the

feudal

and

courts
as
a
reaction
to
the
rise
of
royal
absolute
power
in

Louis

the

The
monarchy
reached
its
peak
during

century
and
the
reign
of
Louis
XIV
By
turning
powerful
feudal
lords
into
courtiers
at
the
Palace
of

Louis
XIV
s
personal
power
became
unchallenged
Remembered
for
his
numerous
wars
he
made
France
the
leading
European
power
France
became
the
most
populous
country
in
Europe
and
had
tremendous
influence
over
European
politics

and
remained
so
until

The
Storming
of
the
Bastille
on
14
July
1789
was
the
most
emblematic
event
of
the
French
Revolution
Facing
financial
troubles
King
Louis
XVI
summoned
the
Estates
General
gathering
the
three
Estates
of
the
realm
in
May
1789
to
propose
solutions
to
his
government
As
it
came
to
an
impasse
the
representatives
of
the
Third
Estate
formed
into
a
National
Assembly
signalling
the
outbreak
of
the
French
Revolution
Fearing
that
the
king
would
suppress
the
newly
created
National
Assembly
insurgents
stormed
the
Bastille
on
14
July
1789
a
date
which
would
become
France
s
National
Day
Early
August
1789
the
National
Constituent
Assembly
abolished
the
privileges
of
the
nobility
such
as
personal
serfdom
and
exclusive
hunting
rights
Through
the
Declaration
of
the
Rights
of
Man
and
of
the
Citizen
27
August
1789
France
established
fundamental
rights
for
men
The
Declaration
affirms
the
natural
and
imprescriptible
rights
of
man
to
liberty
property
security
and
resistance
to
oppression
Freedom
of
speech
and
press
were
declared
and
arbitrary
arrests
outlawed
It
called
for
the
destruction
of
aristocratic
privileges
and
proclaimed
freedom
and
equal
rights
for
all
men
as
well
as
access
to
public
office
based
on
talent
rather
than
birth
In
November
1789
the
Assembly
decided
to
nationalize
and
sell
all
property
of
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
which
had
been
the
largest
landowner
in
the
country
In
July
1790
a
Civil
Constitution
of
the
Clergy
reorganised
the
French
Catholic
Church
cancelling
the
authority
of
the
Church
to
levy
taxes
et
cetera
This
fueled
much
discontent
in
parts
of
France
which
would
contribute
to
the
civil
war
breaking
out
some
years
later
While
King
Louis
XVI
still
enjoyed
popularity
among
the
population
his
disastrous
flight
to
Varennes
June
1791
seemed
to
justify
rumours
he
had
tied
his
hopes
of
political
salvation
to
the
prospects
of
foreign
invasion
His
credibility
was
so
deeply
undermined
that
the
abolition
of
the
monarchy
and
establishment
of
a
republic
became
an
increasing
possibility
In
August
1791
the
Emperor
of
Austria
and
the
King
of
Prussia
in
the
Declaration
of
Pillnitz
threatened
revolutionary
France
to
intervene
by
force
of
arms
to
restore
the
French
absolute
monarchy
In
September
1791
the
National
Constituent
Assembly
forced
King
Louis
XVI
to
accept
the
French
Constitution
of
1791
thus
turning
the
French
absolute
monarchy
into
a
constitutional
monarchy
In
the
newly
established
Legislative
Assembly
October
1791
enmity
developed
and
deepened
between
a
group
later
called
the
Girondins
who
favored
war
with
Austria
and
Prussia
and
a
group
later
called
Montagnards
or
Jacobins
who
opposed
such
war
But
a
majority
in
the
Assembly
in
1792
saw
a
war
with
Austria
and
Prussia
as
a
chance
to
boost
the
popularity
of
the
revolutionary
government
and
thought
that
France
would
win
a
war
against
those
gathered
monarchies
On
20
April
1792
therefore
they
declared
war
on
Austria
55
On
10
August
1792
an
angry
crowd
threatened
the
palace
of
King
Louis
XVI
who
took
refuge
in
the
Legislative
Assembly
56
57
A
Prussian
army
invaded
France
later
in
August
1792
Early
September
Parisians
infuriated
by
the
Prussian
army
capturing
Verdun
and
counter
revolutionary
uprisings
in
the
west
of
France
murdered
between
1
000
and
1
500
prisoners
by
raiding
the
Parisian
prisons
The
Assembly
and
the
Paris
city
council
seemed
unable
to
stop
that
bloodshed

The
National
Convention
chosen
in
the
first
elections
under
male
universal
suffrage
56
on
20

succeeded
the
Legislative

and
on

A

came
to

climax
with
the
group
of

on

being
forced
to
resign
and

Political
disagreements

in

between

and
July

reached
unprecedented
levels
leading
to
dozens
of

members
being
sentenced

and

Meanwhile
France
s
external
wars
in

were
going

climactic
Battle
of
Dien

Only
months
later
France
faced
another
anti
colonialist
conflict
in
Algeria
Torture
and
illegal
executions
were
perpetrated
by
both
sides
and
the
debate
over
whether
or
not

keep
control
of
Algeria

the
weak

gave

72
In
the
latter
role
Charles
de

managed
to
keep
the
country
together
while
taking
steps
to
end
the
war
The
Algerian

was
concluded
with
the

in

that
led
to
Algerian
independence
A

In
the
context
of
the
Cold
War
de
Gaulle
pursued
a
policy
of
national
independence
towards
the
Western
and
Eastern
blocs
To
this
end
he
withdrew
from
NATO
s
military
integrated
command
he
launched
a
nuclear
development
programme
and
made
France
the
fourth
nuclear
power
He
restored
cordial
Franco
German
relations
in
order
to
create
a
European
counterweight
between
the
American
and
Soviet
spheres
of
influence
However
he
opposed
any
development
of
a
supranational
Europe
favouring
a
Europe
of
sovereign
Nations
In
the
wake
of
the
series
of
worldwide
protests
of
1968
the
revolt
of
May
1968
had
an
enormous
social
impact
In
France
it
is
considered
to
be
the
watershed
moment
when
a
conservative
moral
ideal
religion
patriotism
respect
for
authority
shifted
towards
a
more
liberal
moral
ideal
secularism
individualism
sexual
revolution
Although
the
revolt
was
a
political
failure
as
the
Gaullist
party
emerged
even
stronger
than
before
it
announced
a
split
between
the
French
people
and
de
Gaulle
who
resigned
shortly
after
Republican
march
Place
de
la
R
publique
Paris
In
the
post
Gaullist
era
France
remained
one
of
the
most
developed
economies
in
the
World
but
faced
several
economic
crises
that
resulted
in
high
unemployment
rates
and
increasing
public
debt
In
the
late
20th
and
early
21st
centuries
France
has
been
at
the
forefront
of
the
development
of
a
supranational
European
Union
notably
by
signing
the
Maastricht
Treaty
which
created
the
European
Union
in
1992
establishing
the
Eurozone
in
1999
and
signing
the
Lisbon
Treaty
in
2007
73
France
has
also
gradually
but
fully
reintegrated
into
NATO
and
has
since
participated
in
most
NATO
sponsored
wars
74
Since
the
19th
century
France
has
received
many
immigrants
These
have
been
mostly
male
foreign
workers
from
European
Catholic
countries
who
generally
returned
home
when
not
employed
75
During
the
1970s
France
faced
economic
crisis
and
allowed
new
immigrants
mostly
from
the
Maghreb
75
to
permanently
settle
in
France
with
their
families
and
to
acquire
French
citizenship
It
resulted
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
Muslims
especially
in
the
larger
cities
living
in
subsidised
public
housing
and
suffering
from
very
high
unemployment
rates
76
Simultaneously
France
renounced
the
assimilation
of
immigrants
where
they
were
expected
to
adhere
to
French
traditional
values
and
cultural
norms
They
were
encouraged
to
retain
their
distinctive
cultures
and
traditions
and
required
merely
to
integrate
77
Since
the
1995
Paris
M
tro
and
RER
bombings
France
has
been
sporadically
targeted
by
Islamist
organisations
notably
the
Charlie
Hebdo
attack
in
January
2015
which
provoked
the
largest
public
rallies
in

Climate
Most

are
located
in
the
oceanic
climate
zone
Cfb

in

K
ppen
classification
A
small
part
of
the
territory
bordering
the
mediterranean
basin
lies
in
the
Csa
and
Csb
zones
As
the
French
metropolitan
territory
is
relatively
large
the
climate
is
not
uniform
giving
rise
to
the
following
climate
nuances
The
west
of
France
has
strictly
oceanic
climate
it
extends
from
Flanders
to
the
Basque
Country
in
a
coastal
strip
several
tens
of
kilometres
wide
narrower
to
the
north
and
south
but
wider
in
Brittany
which
is
almost
entirely
in
this
climate
zone
The
climate
of
the
South
is
also
oceanic
but
warmer
The
climate
of
the
Northwest
is
oceanic
but
cooler
and
windier
Away
from
the
coast
the
climate
is
oceanic
throughout
but
its
characteristics
change
somewhat
The
Paris
sedimentary
basin
and
more
so
the
basins
protected
by
mountain
chains
show
a
stronger
seasonal
temperature
variability
and
less
rainfall
during
autumn
and
winter
Therefore
most
of
the
territory
has
a
semi
oceanic
climate
and
forms
a
transition
zone
between
strictly
oceanic
climate
near
the
coasts
and
the
Semi

climate

the
north
and
centre
east

of

and

The

experience
a
Mediterranean
climate
due
to
the
effect
of
mountain
chains
isolating
them
from
the
rest

country
and
the
resulting
Mistral
and

France
is
ranked
only
17th
by
carbon

emissions
behind
less

nations
such
as

This
is
because

decided
to

crisis

Prime

The
French
Republic
is
a
unitary
semi
presidential
representative
democratic
republic
with
strong
democratic
traditions
112
The
constitution
of
the
Fifth
Republic
was
approved
by
referendum
on
28
September
1958
113
It
greatly
strengthened
the
authority
of
the
executive
in
relation
to
parliament
The
executive
branch
itself
has
two
leaders
the
President
of
the
Republic
currently
Emmanuel
Macron
who
is
head
of
state
and
is
elected
directly
by
universal
adult
suffrage
for
a
5
year
term
formerly
7
years
114
and
the
Government
led
by
the
president
appointed
Prime
Minister
The
French
parliament
is
a
bicameral
legislature
comprising
a
National
Assembly
Assembl
e
Nationale
and
a
Senate
115
The
National
Assembly
deputies
represent
local
constituencies
and
are
directly
elected
for
5
year
terms
116
The
Assembly
has
the
power
to
dismiss
the
government
and
thus
the
majority
in
the
Assembly
determines
the
choice
of
government
Senators
are
chosen
by
an
electoral
college
for
6
year
terms
originally
9
year
terms
and
one
half
of
the
seats
are
submitted
to
election
every

starting
in
September
2008

The
Senate
s
legislative
powers
are
limited
in
the
event
of
disagreement
between
the
two
chambers
the
National
Assembly
has
the
final
say
118
The
Government
has
a
strong
influence
in
shaping
the
agenda
of
Parliament
Until
World
War
II
Radicals
were
a
strong
political
force
in
France
embodied
by
the
Republican
Radical
and
Radical
Socialist
Party
which
was
the
most
important
party
of
the
Third
Republic
Since
World
War
II
they
were
marginalized
while
French
politics
became
characterised
by
two
politically
opposed
groupings
one
left
wing
centred
on
the
French
Section
of
the
Workers
International
and
its
successor
the
Socialist
Party
since
1969
and
the
other
right
wing
centred
on
the
Gaullist
Party
whose
name
changed

Law
Main
article
Law
of
France
France
uses
a
civil
legal
system
83
that
is
law
arises
primarily
from
written
statutes
judges
are
not
to
make
law
but
merely
to
interpret
it
though
the
amount
of
judicial
interpretation
in
certain
areas
makes
it
equivalent
to
case
law
Basic
principles
of
the
rule
of
law
were
laid
in
the
Napoleonic
Code
which
was
in
turn
largely
based
on
the
royal
law
codified
under
Louis
XIV
In
agreement
with
the
principles
of
the
Declaration
of
the
Rights
of
Man
and
of
the
Citizen
law
should
only
prohibit
actions
detrimental
to
society
As
Guy
Canivet
first
president
of
the
Court
of
Cassation
wrote
about
the
management
of
prisons
Freedom
is
the
rule
and
its
restriction
is
the
exception
any
restriction
of
Freedom
must
be
provided
for
by
Law
and
must
follow
the
principles
of
necessity
and
proportionality
That
is
Law
should
lay
out
prohibitions
only
if
they
are
needed
and
if
the
inconveniences
caused
by
this
restriction
do
not
exceed
the
inconveniences
that
the
prohibition
is
supposed
to
remedy
The
basic
principles
that
the
French
Republic
must
respect
are
found
in
the
1789
Declaration
of
the
Rights
of
Man
and
of
the
Citizen
French
law
is
divided
into
two
principal
areas
private
law
and
public
law
Private
law
includes
in
particular
civil
law
and
criminal
law
Public
law
includes
in
particular
administrative
law
and
constitutional
law
However
in
practical
terms
French
law
comprises
three
principal
areas
of
law
civil
law
criminal
law
and
administrative
law
Criminal
laws
can
only
address
the
future
and
not
the
past
criminal
ex
post
facto
laws
are
prohibited
119
While
administrative
law
is
often
a
subcategory
of
civil
law
in
many
countries
it
is
completely
separated
in
France
and
each
body
of
law
is
headed
by
a
specific
supreme
court
ordinary
courts
which
handle
criminal
and
civil
litigation
are
headed
by
the
Court
of
Cassation
and
administrative
courts
are
headed
by
the
Council
of
State
To
be
applicable
every
law
must
be
officially
published
in
the
Journal

France
does
not
recognise
religious
law
as
a
motivation
for
the
enactment
of
prohibitions
France
has
long
had
neither
blasphemy
laws
nor
sodomy
laws
the
latter
being
abolished
in
1791
However
offences
against
public
decency
contraires
aux
bonnes
m
urs
or
disturbing
public
order
trouble
l
ordre
public
have
been
used
to
repress
public
expressions
of
homosexuality
or
street
prostitution
Since
1999
civil
unions
for
homosexual
couples
are
permitted
and
since
May
2013
same
sex
marriage
and
LGBT
adoption
are
legal
in
France
120
Laws
prohibiting
discriminatory
speech
in
the
press
are
as
old
as
1881
Some
consider
however
that
hate
speech
laws
in
France
are
too
broad
or
severe
and
damage
freedom
of
speech
121
France
has
laws
against
racism
and
antisemitism
122
Since
1990
the
Gayssot
Act
prohibits
Holocaust
denial
Freedom
of
religion
is
constitutionally
guaranteed
by
the
1789
Declaration
of
the
Rights
of
Man
and
of
the
Citizen
The
1905
French
law
on
the
Separation
of
the
Churches
and
the
State
is
the
basis
for
la
cit
state
secularism
the
state
does
not
formally
recognize
any
religion
except
in
Alsace
Moselle
Nonetheless
it
does
recognize
religious
associations
The
Parliament
has
listed
many
religious
movements
as
dangerous
cults
since
1995
and
has
banned
wearing
conspicuous
religious
symbols
in
schools
since
2004
In
2010
it
banned
the
wearing
of
face
covering
Islamic
veils
in
public
human
rights
groups
such
as
Amnesty
International
and
Human
Rights
Watch
described
the
law
as
discriminatory
towards

The
European
Union
allows
free
movement
between
the
member
states
although
France
established
controls
to
curb
Eastern
European
migration
and
immigration
remains
a
contentious
political
issue
In
2008
the
INSEE
estimated
that
the
total
number
of
foreign
born
immigrants
was
around
5
million
8
of
the
population
while
their
French
born
descendants
numbered
6
5
million
or
11
of
the
population
Thus
nearly
a
fifth
of
the
country
s
population
were
either
first
or
second
generation
immigrants
of
which
more
than
5
million
were
of
European
origin
and
4
million
of
Maghrebi
ancestry
243

In

France
granted

to
137

246
In
2014
The
National

INSEE
for
its

published
a
study
which
reported
doubling
of
the
number
of
Spanish
immigrants
Portuguese
and
Italians
in
France
between
2009
and
2012
According
to
the
French
Institute
this
increase
resulting
from
the
financial
crisis
that
hit
several
European
countries
in
that
period
has
pushed
up
the
number
of
Europeans
installed
in
France
247
Statistics
on
Spanish

in
France
show
a
growth
of
107

in

a

has
been

s

The

but
the
use
of

In

to
mandating

the

tries
to
promote
French
in

The
perceived
threat
from
anglicisation
has
prompted
efforts
to
safeguard
the
position
of
the
French
language
in
France
Besides

there
exist
77
vernacular

eight

and
69
in
the

From
the
17th
to
the
mid
20th
century
French
served
as
the
pre
eminent
international
language
of
diplomacy
and
international
affairs
as
well
as
a
lingua

among
the
educated
classes

The
dominant
position
of

was
overtaken
by

since

52
252
253
For
most
of
the
time
in
which
French
served
as
an
international
lingua
franca
it
was
not
the
native
language
of
most
Frenchmen
a
report
in
1794
conducted
by
Henri
Gr
goire
found
that
of
the
country
s
25
million
people
only
three
million
spoke
French
natively
the
rest
spoke
one
of
the
country

many
regional

such
as
Alsatian
Breton
or
Occitan
254
Through
the
expansion
of
public

in
which
French
was
the
sole
language
of
instruction
as
well
as
other
factors
such
as
increased

and
the
rise
of

communication
French
gradually
came
to
be
adopted
by
virtually
the
entire
population
a
process
not
completed
until
the
20th
century
As
a
result
of
France
s
extensive
colonial
ambitions
between
the
17th
and
20th
centuries
French
was
introduced
to
the
Americas
Africa
Polynesia
South
East
Asia
and
the
Caribbean
French
is
the
second
most
studied
foreign
language
in
the
world
after
English
255
and
is
a
lingua

in
some
regions
notably
in

The
legacy
of
French

it
is
nearly
extinct

On

the

was

period
when

individualised
itself
through

style
that
eventually
evolved
into
Naturalism
In
the
second
part
of
the

s
influence
over
painting
became
even
more
important
with
the
development
of

of

Middle

Baroque
architecture
replaced
the
traditional
Gothic
style
However
in
France
baroque
architecture
found
a
greater
success
in
the
secular
domain
than
in
a
religious
one
311
In
the
secular
domain
the
Palace
of
Versailles
has
many
baroque
features
Jules
Hardouin
Mansart
who
designed
the
extensions
to
Versailles
was
one
of
the
most
influential
French
architect
of
the
baroque
era
he
is
famous
for
his
dome
at
Les
Invalides
312
Some
of
the
most
impressive
provincial
baroque
architecture
is
found
in
places
that
were
not
yet
French
such
as
the
Place
Stanislas
in
Nancy
On
the

side
Vauban
designed
some
of
the
most

fortresses
in
Europe
and
became
an
influential
military

imitations

After
the
Revolution
the
Republicans
favoured
Neoclassicism
although
neoclassicism
was
introduced
in
France
prior
to
the
revolution
with
such
building
as
the
Parisian
Pantheon
or
the
Capitole
de

Built
during
the

the
Arc

316
Under
Napoleon
III
a
new
wave
of
urbanism
and
architecture
was
given
birth
extravagant
buildings
such
as
the
neo
baroque
Palais
Garnier
were
built
The
urban
planning
of
the
time
was
very
organised
and
rigorous
for
example
Haussmann
s
renovation
of
Paris
The
architecture
associated
to
this
era
is
named
Second
Empire
in
English
the
term
being
taken
from
the
Second
French
Empire
At
this
time
there
was
a
strong
Gothic
resurgence
across
Europe
and
in
France
the
associated
architect
was
Eug
ne
Viollet
le
Duc
In
the
late
19th
century
Gustave
Eiffel
designed
many
bridges
such
as
Garabit
viaduct
and
remains
one
of
the
most
influential
bridge
designers
of
his
time
although
he
is
best
remembered
for
the
iconic
Eiffel
Tower
In
the
20th
century
French
Swiss
architect
Le
Corbusier
designed
several
buildings
in
France
More
recently
French
architects
have
combined
both
modern
and
old
architectural
styles
The
Louvre
Pyramid
is
an
example
of
modern
architecture
added
to
an
older
building
The
most
difficult
buildings
to
integrate
within
French
cities
are
skyscrapers
as
they
are
visible
from
afar
For
instance
in
Paris
since
1977
new
buildings
had
to
be
under
37
meters
121
feet
317
France
s
largest
financial
district
is
La
Defense
where
a
significant
number
of
skyscrapers
are
located
318
Other
massive
buildings
that
are
a
challenge
to
integrate
into
their
environment
are
large
bridges
an
example
of
the
way
this
has
been
done
is
the
Millau
Viaduct
Some
famous
modern
French
architects
include
Jean

Christian

French

The
earliest
French
literature
dates
from
the
Middle
Ages
when
what
is
now
known
as
modern
France
did
not
have
a
single
uniform
language
There
were
several
languages
and
dialects
and
writers
used
their
own
spelling
and
grammar
Some
authors
of
French
mediaeval
texts
are
unknown
such
as
Tristan
and
Iseult
and
Lancelot
Grail
Other
authors
are
known
for

Chr
tien
de
Troyes
and
Duke
William
IX
of
Aquitaine
who
wrote
in
Occitan
Much
medieval
French
poetry
and
literature
were
inspired
by
the
legends
of
the
Matter

The
Song
of
Roland
and
the
various
chansons
de

The
Roman
de

Reynard
the
Fox

Several

and

Nouvelle

began
in
the
country
It
is
noted
for
having
a
strong

due
in

to
protections
afforded
by

its
strong
and
innovative
film
tradition
France
has
also
been
a
gathering
spot
for
artists
from
across
Europe
and
the
world
For
this
reason
French
cinema
is
sometimes
intertwined
with
the
cinema
of
foreign

Directors

centuries
been

although
its

position
has
been
surpassed
by

Subsequently
France
takes
steps
in
protecting
and
promoting
its
culture
becoming
a
leading
advocate
of
the
cultural
exception

Fashion
has
been
an
important
industry
and
cultural
export
of
France
since
the
17th
century
and
modern
haute
couture
originated
in
Paris
in
the
1860s
Today
Paris
along
with
London
Milan
and
New
York
City
is
considered
one
of
the
world
s
fashion
capitals
and
the
city
is
home
or
headquarters
to
many
of
the
premier
fashion
houses
The
expression
Haute
couture
is
in
France
a
legally
protected
name
guaranteeing
certain
quality
standards
The
association
of
France
with
fashion
and
style
French
la
mode
dates
largely
to
the
reign
of
Louis
XIV
361
when
the
luxury
goods
industries
in
France
came
increasingly
under
royal
control
and
the
French
royal
court
became
arguably
the
arbiter
of
taste
and
style
in
Europe
But
France
renewed
its
dominance
of
the
high
fashion
French
couture
or
haute
couture
industry
in
the
years
1860
1960
through
the
establishing
of
the
great
couturier
houses
such
as
Chanel
Dior
and
Givenchy
The
French
perfume
industry
is
world
leader
in
its
sector
and
is
centered
on
the
town
of
Grasse
362
In
the
1960s
the
elitist
Haute
couture
came
under
criticism
from
France
s
youth
culture
In
1966
the
designer
Yves
Saint
Laurent
broke
with
established
Haute
Couture
norms
by
launching
a
pr
t
porter
ready
to
wear
line
and
expanding
French
fashion
into
mass
manufacturing
With
a
greater
focus
on
marketing
and
manufacturing
new
trends
were
established
by
Sonia
Rykiel
Thierry
Mugler
Claude
Montana
Jean
Paul
Gaultier
and
Christian
Lacroix
in
the
1970s
and

Conf
d

Rhin
was
a
confederation
of
client
states
of
the
First
French
Empire
It
was
formed
initially
from
16
German
states
by
Napoleon
after
he
defeated
Austria
and
Russia
at
the
Battle
of
Austerlitz
The
Treaty
of
Pressburg
in
effect
led
to
the
creation
of
the
Confederation
of
the
Rhine
It
lasted
from
1806
to
1813
1
The
members
of
the
confederation
were
German
princes
F
rsten
from
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
They
were
later
joined
by
19
others
all
together
ruling
a
total
of
over
15
million
subjects
providing
a
significant
strategic
advantage
to
the
French
Empire
on
its
eastern
front
by
providing
a
separation
between
France
and
the
two
largest
German
states
Prussia
and
Austria
to
the
east
which
were
not
members
of
the
Confederation
of
the
Rhine
Napoleon
sought
to
consolidate
the
modernizing
achievements
of
the
revolution
but
he
wanted
the
soldiers
and
supplies
these
subject
states
could
provide
for
his
wars
Napoleon
required
it
to
supply
63
000
troops
to
his
army
The
success
of
the
Confederation
depended
on
Napoleon
s
success
in
battle
it
collapsed
when
he
lost
the
Battle
of
Leipzig
in
1813

On
12
July
1806
on
signing
the
Treaty
of
the
Confederation
of
the
Rhine
German
Rheinbundakte
in
Paris
16
states
in
present
day
Germany
joined
together
in
a
confederation
the
treaty
called
it
the
tats
conf
d
r
s
du
Rhinelande
with
a
precursor
in
the
League
of
the
Rhine
2
Napoleon
was
its
protector
On
1
August
the
members
of
the
confederation
formally
seceded
from
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
and
on
6
August
following
an
ultimatum
by
Napoleon
Francis
II
declared
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
dissolved
Francis
and
his
Habsburg
dynasty
continued
as
emperors
of
Austria
According
to
the
treaty
the
confederation
was
to
be
run
by
common
constitutional
bodies
but
the
individual
states
in
particular
the
larger
ones
wanted
unlimited
sovereignty
1
Instead
of
a
monarchical
head
of
state
as
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
had
had
its
highest
office
was
held
by
Karl
Theodor
von
Dalberg
the
former
Arch
Chancellor
who
now
bore
the
title
of
a
Prince
Primate
of
the
confederation
As
such
he
was
President
of
the
College
of
Kings
and
presided
over
the
Diet
of
the
Confederation
designed
to
be
a
parliament
like
body
although
it
never
actually
assembled
1
The
President
of
the
Council
of
the
Princes
was
the
Prince
of
Nassau
Usingen
In
return
for
their
support
of
Napoleon
some
rulers
were
given
higher
statuses
Baden
Hesse
Cleves
and
Berg
were
made
into
grand
duchies
and
W
rttemberg
and
Bavaria
became
kingdoms
States
were
also
made
larger
by
incorporating
the
many
smaller
Kleinstaaten
or
small
former
imperial
member
states
They
had
to
pay
a
very
high
price
for
their
new
status
however
The
Confederation
was
above
all
a
military
alliance
the
members
had
to
maintain
substantial
armies
for
mutual
defense
and
supply
France
with
large
numbers
of
military
personnel
As
events
played
out
the
members
of
the
confederation
found
themselves
more
subordinated
to
Napoleon
than
they
had
been
to
the
Habsburgs
3
After
Prussia
lost
to
France
in
1806
Napoleon
cajoled
most
of
the
secondary
states
of
Germany
into
the
Confederation
of
the
Rhine
Eventually
an
additional
23
German
states
joined
the
Confederation
It
was
at
its
largest
in
1808
when
it
included
36
states
four
kingdoms
five
grand
duchies
13
duchies
seventeen
principalities
and
the
Free
Hansa
towns
of
Hamburg
L
beck
and
Bremen

Only
Austria
Prussia
Danish
Holstein
and
Swedish
Pomerania
stayed
outside
not
counting
the
west
bank
of
the
Rhine
and
the
Principality
of
Erfurt
which
were
annexed
by
the
French
empire
In
1810
large
parts
of
what
is
now
northwest
Germany
were
quickly
annexed
to
France
in
order
to
better
monitor
the
trade
embargo
with
Great
Britain
the
Continental
System
The
Confederation
of
the
Rhine
collapsed
in
1813
in
the
aftermath
of
Napoleon
s
failed
campaign
against
the
Russian
Empire
Many
of
its
members
changed
sides
after
the
Battle
of
Leipzig
when
it
became
apparent
Napoleon
would

of
the

Etymology
edit
The
word
comes
from
Middle
English
amortisen
to
kill
alienate
in
mortmain
from
Anglo
French
amorteser
alteration
of
amortir
from
Vulgar
Latin
admortire
to
kill
from
Latin
ad
and
mort
death
Applications
of
amortization
edit
When
used
in
the
context
of
a
home
purchase
amortization
is
the
process
by
which
loan
principal
decreases
over
the
life
of
a
loan
typically
an
amortizing
loan
As
each
mortgage
payment
is
made
part
of
the
payment
is
applied
as
interest
on
the
loan
and
the
remainder
of
the
payment
is
applied
towards
reducing
the
principal
An
amortization
schedule
a
table
detailing
each
periodic
payment
on
a
loan
shows
the
amounts
of
principal
and
interest
and
demonstrates
how
a
loan
s
principal
amount
decreases
over
time
An
amortization
schedule
can
be
generated
by
an
amortization
calculator
Negative
amortization
is
an
amortization
schedule
where
the
loan
amount
actually
increases
through
not
paying
the
full
interest
In
business
amortization
allocates
a
lump
sum
amount
to
different
time
periods
particularly
for
loans
and
other
forms
of
finance
including
related
interest
or
other
finance
charges
Amortization
is
also
applied
to
capital
expenditures
of
certain
assets
under
accounting
rules
particularly
intangible
assets
in
a
manner
analogous
to
depreciation
In
tax
law
in
the
United
States
amortization
refers
to
the
cost
recovery
system
for
intangible
property
In
computer
science
amortized
analysis
is
a
method
of
analyzing
the
execution
cost
of
algorithms
over
a
sequence
of
operations
3
In
the
context
of
zoning
regulations
amortization
refers
to
the
time
period
a
non
conforming
property
has
to
conform
to
a
new
zoning
classification
before
the
non
conforming
use
becomes
prohibited
For
example
if
the
city
rezones
property
from
industrial
to
residential
and
sets
an
amortization
period
of
one
year
all
property
within
the
rezoned
boundary
must
move
from
industrial
use
to
residential
use
within
one
year

a

and
continued
to
exist
until
1918
The

House
of
Wittelsbach
became
the
first
King
of
Bavaria
in
1805
as

The
crown
would

History
of
Bavaria
On
30
December
1777
the
Bavarian
line
of
the
Wittelsbachs
became
extinct
and
the
succession
on
the
Electorate
of
Bavaria
passed
to
Charles
Theodore
the
Elector
Palatine
After
a
separation
of
four
and
a
half
centuries
the
Palatinate
to
which
the
duchies
of
J
lich
and
Berg
had
been
added
was
thus
reunited
with
Bavaria
In
1792
French
revolutionary
armies
overran
the
Palatinate
in
1795
the
French
under
Moreau
invaded
Bavaria
itself
advanced
to
Munich
where
they
were
received
with
joy
by
the
long
suppressed
Liberals
and
laid
siege
to
Ingolstadt
Charles
Theodore
who
had
done
nothing
to
prevent
wars
or
to
resist
the
invasion
fled
to
Saxony
leaving
a
regency
the
members
of
which
signed
a
convention
with
Moreau
by
which
he
granted
an
armistice
in
return
for
a
heavy
contribution
7
September
1796
Between
the
French
and
the
Austrians
Bavaria
was
now
in
a
bad
situation
Before
the
death
of
Charles
Theodore
16
February
1799
the
Austrians
had
again
occupied
the
country
in
preparation
for
renewing
the
war
with
France
Maximilian
von
Montgelas
Maximilian
IV
Joseph
of
Zweibr
cken
the
new
elector
succeeded
to
a
difficult
inheritance
Though
his
own
sympathies
and
those
of
his
all
powerful
minister
Maximilian
von
Montgelas
were
if
anything
French
rather
than
Austrian
the
state
of
the
Bavarian
finances
and
the
fact
that
the
Bavarian
troops
were
scattered
and
disorganized
placed
him
helpless
in
the
hands
of
Austria
on
2
December
1800
the
Bavarian
arms
were
involved
in
the
Austrian
defeat
at
Hohenlinden
and
Moreau
once
more
occupied
Munich
By
the
Treaty
of
Lun
ville
9
February
1801
Bavaria
lost
the
Palatinate
and
the
duchies
of
Zweibr
cken
and
J
lich
In
view
of
the
scarcely
disguised
ambitions
and
intrigues
of
the
Austrian
court
Montgelas
now
believed
that
the
interests
of
Bavaria
lay
in
a
frank
alliance
with
the
French
Republic
he
succeeded
in
overcoming
the
reluctance
of
Maximilian
Joseph
and
on
24
August
a
separate
treaty
of
peace
and
alliance
with
France
was
signed
at
Paris
The
1805
Peace
of
Pressburg
allowed
Maximilian
to
raise
Bavaria
to
the
status
of
a
kingdom
Accordingly
Maximilian
proclaimed
himself
king
on
1
January
1806
The
King
still
served
as
an
Elector
until
Bavaria
seceded
from
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
on
1
August
1806
The
Duchy
of
Berg
was
ceded
to
Napoleon
only
in
1806
The
new
kingdom
faced
challenges
from
the
outset
of
its
creation
relying
on
the
support
of
Napoleonic
France
The
kingdom
faced
war
with
Austria
in
1808
and
from
1810
to
1814
lost
territory
to
W
rttemberg
Italy
and
then
Austria
In
1808
all
relics
of
serfdom
were
abolished
which
had
left
the
old
empire
In
the
same
year
Maximilian
promulgated
Bavaria
s
first
written
constitution
Over
the
next
five
years
it
was
amended
numerous
times
in
accordance
with
Paris
wishes
During
the
French
invasion
of
Russia
in
1812
about
30
000
Bavarian
soldiers
were
killed
in
action
With
the
Treaty
of
Ried
of
8
October
1813
Bavaria
left
the
Confederation
of
the
Rhine
and
agreed
to
join
the
Sixth
Coalition
against
Napoleon
in
exchange
for
a
guarantee
of
her
continued
sovereign
and
independent
status
On
14
October
Bavaria
made
a
formal
declaration
of
war
against
Napoleonic
France
The
treaty
was
passionately
backed
by
the
Crown
Prince
Ludwig
and
by
Marshal
von
Wrede
With
the
Battle
of
Leipzig
in
October
1813
ended
the
German
Campaign
with
the
Coalition
nations
as
the
victors
in
a
complete
failure
for
the
French
although
they
achieved
a
minor
victory
when
an
army
of
Kingdom
of
Bavaria
attempted
to
block
the
retreat
of
the
French
Grande
Arm
e
at
Hanau
With
the
defeat
of
Napoleon
s
France
in
1814
Bavaria
was
compensated
for
some
of
its
losses
and
received
new
territories
such
as
the
Grand
Duchy
of
W
rzburg
the
Archbishopric
of
Mainz
Aschaffenburg
and
parts
of
the
Grand
Duchy
of
Hesse
Finally
in
1816
the
Rhenish
Palatinate
was
taken
from
France
in
exchange
for
most
of
Salzburg
which
was
then
ceded
to
Austria
Treaty
of
Munich
1816
It
was
the
second
largest
and
second
most
powerful
state
south
of
the
Main
behind
only
Austria
In
Germany
as
a
whole
it
ranked
third
behind
Prussia
and
Austria
Between
1799
and
1817
the
leading
minister
Count
Montgelas
followed
a
strict
policy
of
modernisation
and
laid
the
foundations
of
administrative
structures
that
survived
even
the
monarchy
and
are
in
their
core
valid
until
today
On
1
February
1817
Montgelas
had
been
dismissed
and
Bavaria
had
entered
on
a
new
era
of
constitutional
reform
Constitution
edit
On
26
May
1818
Bavaria
s
second
constitution
was
proclaimed
The
constitution
established
a
bicameral
Parliament
Landtag
The
upper
house
Kammer
der
Reichsr
te
comprising
the
aristocracy
and
noblemen
including
the
royal
princes
government
officials
archbishops
high
class
hereditary
landowners
and
nominees
of
the
crown
The
lower
house
Kammer
der
Abgeordneten
would
include
representatives
of
landowners
the
three
universities
clergy
Catholic
and
Protestant
the
towns
and
the
peasants
Without
the
consent
of
both
houses
no
law
could
be
passed
and
no
tax
could
be
levied
The
rights
of
Protestants
were
safeguarded
in
the
constitution
with
articles
supporting
the
equality
of
all
religions
despite
opposition
by
supporters
of
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
The
initial
constitution
almost
proved
disastrous
for
the
monarchy
with
controversies
such
as
the
army
having
to
swear
allegiance
to
the
new
constitution
The
monarchy
appealed
to
the
Kingdom
of
Prussia
and
the
Austrian
Empire
for
advice
the
two
refused
to
take
action
on
Bavaria
s
behalf
but
the
debacles
lessened
and
the
state
stabilized
with
the
accession
of
Ludwig
I
to
the
throne
following
the
death
of
Maximilian
in
1825
Within
the
Kingdom
of
Bavaria
the
Palatinate
enjoyed
a
special
legal
and
administrative
position
as
the
Bavarian
government
maintained
substantial
achievements
of
the
French
period
The
German
historian
Heiner
Haan
1
described
the
special
status
of
the
Palatinate
within
Bavaria
as
a
relation
of
Hauptstaat
main
state
i
e
Bavaria
and
Nebenstaat

the
Palatinate
Ludwig
I
Maximilian
II
and
the
Revolutions
edit
In
1825
Ludwig
I
ascended
the
throne
of
Bavaria
Under
Ludwig
the
arts
flourished
in
Bavaria
and
Ludwig
personally
ordered
and
financially
assisted
the
creation
of
many
neoclassical
buildings
and
architecture
across
Bavaria
Ludwig
also
increased
Bavaria
s
pace
towards
industrialization
under
his
reign
In
foreign
affairs
under
Ludwig
s
rule
Bavaria
supported
the
Greeks
during
the
Greek
War
of
Independence
with
his
second
son
Otto
being
elected
King
of
Greece
in
1832
As
for
politics
initial
reforms
advocated
by
Ludwig
were
both
liberal
and
reform
oriented
However
after
the
Revolutions
of
1830
Ludwig
turned
to
conservative
reaction
The
Hambacher
Fest
in
1832
showed
the
discontent
of
the
population
with
high
taxes
and
censorship
Bavaria
joined
the
Zollverein
in
1834
In
1835
the
first
German
railway
was
constructed
in
Bavaria
between
the
cities
of
F
rth
and
Nuremberg
Crown
of
Bavaria
Munich
Residence
In
1837
the
Roman
Catholic
supported
clerical
movement
the
Ultramontanes
came
to
power
in
the
Bavarian
parliament
and
began
a
campaign
of
reform
to
the
constitution
which
removed
civil
rights
that
had
earlier
been
granted
to
Protestants
as
well
as
enforcing
censorship
and
forbidding
the
free
discussion
of
internal
politics
This
regime
was
short
lived
due
to
the
demand
by
the
Ultramontanes
of
the
naturalization
of
Ludwig
I
s
Irish
mistress
which
was
resented
by
Ludwig
and
the
Ultramontanes
were
pushed
out
King
Ludwig
I
of
Bavaria
Following
the
Revolutions
of
1848
and
Ludwig
s
low
popularity
Ludwig
I
abdicated
the
throne
to
avoid
a
potential
coup
and
allowed
his
son
Maximilian
II
to
become
the
King
of
Bavaria
Maximilian
II
responded
to
the
demands
of
the
people
for
a
united
German
state
by
attending
the
Frankfurt
Assembly
which
intended
to
create
such
a
state
But
when
Maximilian
II
rejected
the
Frankfurt
Constitution
in
1849
an
uprising
in
the
Bavarian
Palatinate
under
Joseph
Martin
Reichard
was
put
down
with
the
support
of
Prussian
forces
However
Maximilian
II
stood
alongside
Bavaria
s
ally
the
Austrian
Empire
in
opposition
to
Austria
s
enemy
the
Kingdom
of
Prussia
which
was
to
receive
the
imperial
crown
of
a
united
Germany
This
opposition
was
resented
by
many
Bavarian
citizens
who
wanted
a
united
Germany
but
in
the
end
Prussia
declined
accepting
the
crown
and
the
constitution
of
a
German
state
they
perceived
to
be
too
liberal
and
not
in
Prussia
s
interests

In
the
aftermath
of
the
failure
of
the
Frankfurt
Assembly
Prussia
and
Austria
continued
to
debate
over
which
monarchy
had
the
inherent
right
to
rule
Germany
A
dispute
between
Austria
and
the
Electoral
Prince
of
Hesse
Kassel
or
Hesse
Cassel
was
used
by
Austria
and
its
allies
including
Bavaria
to
promote
the
isolation
of
Prussia
in
German
political
affairs
This
diplomatic
insult
almost
led
to
war
when
Austria
Bavaria
and
other
allies
moved
troops
through
Bavaria
towards
Hesse
Kassel
in
1850
However
the
Prussian
army
backed
down
to
Austria
and
caved
in
to
the
acceptance
of
dual
leadership
This
event
was
known
as
the
Punctation
of
Olm
tz
but
also
known
as
the
Humiliation
of
Olm
tz
by
Prussia
This
event
solidified
the
Bavarian
kingdom
s
alliance
with
Austria
against
Prussia
When

were
therefore

also
the

at

The

of

was
finally
beaten
shortly
afterwards
at
Uettingen
26
July
1866
Finally
Bavaria
lost
Gersfeld
and
Bad
Orb
to
Prussia
They
were
become

Austria
was
humiliated
by
defeat
and
was
forced
to
concede
control

its

over
the

Bavaria
was
spared
harsh
terms
in

from

on

and

steadily
progressed

With
Austria
s
defeat
in
the
Austro
Prussian
War
the
northern
German
states
quickly
unified
into
the
North

Confederation
with
Prussia

King
leading
the
state
Bavaria
s
previous
inhibitions
towards
Prussia
changed
along
with
those
of
many
of
the
south
German
states
after
French
emperor
Napoleon
III
began
speaking
of
France
s
need
for
compensation
from
its
loss
in
1814
and
included
Bavarian
held
Palatinate
as
part
of
its
territorial
claims
Ludwig
II
joined
an
alliance
with
Prussia
in
1870
against
France
which
was
seen
by
Germans
as
the
greatest
enemy
to
a
united
Germany
At
the
same
time
Bavaria
increased
its
political
legal
and
trade
ties
with
the
North
German
Confederation
In
1870
war
erupted
between
France
and
Prussia
in

War
The
Bavarian
Army
was
sent
under

command
of
the
Prussian
crown

King
Ludwig
II
With
France
s
defeat
and
humiliation
against
the
combined
German
forces
it
was
Ludwig
II
who
proposed
that
Prussian
King
Wilhelm
I
be
proclaimed
German
Emperor
or
Kaiser
of
the
German
Empire
Deutsches
Reich
which
occurred
in
1871

The
territories
of
the
German
Empire
were
declared
which
included
the
states
of
the
North
German
Confederation
and
all
of
the
south
German
states
with
the
major
exception
of
Austria
The
Empire
also
annexed
the
formerly
French
territory
of
Alsace
Lorraine
due
in
large
part
to
Ludwig
s
desire
to
move
the
French
frontier
away
from

in
Bavaria
Bavaria
s
entry
into
the
German
Empire
changed
from
jubilation
over
France
s
defeat
to
dismay
shortly
afterward
because
of
the
direction
Germany
took
under
the
new
German
Chancellor
and
Prussian
Prime
Minister
Otto
von
Bismarck
The
Bavarian
delegation
under
Count
Otto
von
Bray
Steinburg
had
secured
a
privileged
status
for
the
Kingdom
of
Bavaria
within
the
German
Empire
Reservatrechte
The
Kingdom
of
Bavaria
was
even
able
to
retain
its
own
diplomatic
body
and
its
own
army
which
would
fall
under
Prussian
command
only
in
times
of
war
After
Bavaria
s
entry
into
the
Empire
Ludwig
II
became
increasingly
detached
from
Bavaria
s
political
affairs
and
spent
vast
amounts
of
money
on
personal
projects
such
as
the
construction
of
a
number
of
fairytale
castles
and
palaces
the
most
famous
being
the
Wagnerian
style
Castle
Neuschwanstein
Ludwig
used
his
personal
wealth
to
finance
these
projects
and
not
state
funds
and
the
construction
projects
landed
him
deeply
in
debt
These
debts
caused
much
concern
among
Bavaria
s
political
elite
who
sought
to
persuade
Ludwig
to
cease
his
building
he
refused
and
relations
between
the
government
s
ministers
and
the
crown
deteriorated
At
last
in
1886
the
crisis
came
to
a
head
the
Bavarian
ministers
deposed
the
king
organizing
a
medical
commission
to
declare
him
insane
and
therefore
incapable
of
executing
his
governmental
powers
A
day
after
Ludwig
s
deposition
the
king
died
mysteriously
after
asking
the
commission
s
chief
psychiatrist
to
go
on
a
walk
with
him
along
Lake
Starnberg
then
called
Lake
W
rm
Ludwig
and
the
psychiatrist
were
found
dead
floating
in
the
lake
An
autopsy
listed
cause
of
death
as
suicide
by
drowning
but
some
sources
claim
that
no
water
was
found
in
Ludwig
s
lungs
While
these
facts
could
be
explained
by
dry
drowning
they
have
also
led
to
some
conspiracy
theories
of
political
assassination
Regency
and
institutional
reform
edit
The
crown
passed
to
Ludwig
s
brother
Otto
I
However
Otto
had
a
long
history
of
mental
illness
and
had
been
placed
under
medical
supervision
a
few
months
earlier
The
duties
of
the
throne
actually
rested
in
the
hands
of
the
brothers
uncle
Prince
Luitpold
who
had
begun
serving
as
regent
for
Ludwig
II
a
few
days
earlier
Prince
Regent
Luitpold
Justizpalast
Munich
During
the
regency
of
Prince
Regent
Luitpold
from
1886
to
1912
relations
between
Bavaria
and
Prussia
remained
cold
with
Bavarians
remembering
the
anti
Catholic
agenda
of
Bismarck
s
Kulturkampf
as
well
as
Prussia
s
strategic
dominance
over
the
empire
Bavaria
protested
Prussian
dominance
over
Germany
and
snubbed
the
Prussian
born
German
Emperor
Wilhelm
II
in
1900
by
forbidding
the
flying
of
any
other
flag
other
than
the
Bavarian
flag
on
public
buildings
for
the
Emperor
s
birthday
but
this
was
swiftly
modified
afterwards
allowing
the
German
imperial
flag
to
be
hung
beside
the
Bavarian
flag
The
Catholic
conservative
Patriotic
Party
founded
in
1868
became
the
leading
party
in
the
Bavarian
Landtag
Parliament
In
1887
its
name
was
changed
to
Bavarian
Centre
In
1893
the
Social
Democrats
were
elected
to
the
parliament
From
1903
the
University
Education
was
also
possible
for
female
students
In
1906
a
liberalization
of
the
suffrage
was
carried
out
With
the
Centre
politician
Georg
von
Hertling
the
Prince
Regent
appointed
to
the
head
of
government
for
the
first
time
a
representative
of
the
Landtag
s
majority
Luitpold
s
years
as
regent
were
marked
by
tremendous
artistic
and
cultural
activity
in
Bavaria
where
they
are
known
as
the
Prinzregentenjahre
The
Prince
Regent
Years
In
1912
Luitpold
died
and
his
son
Prince
Regent
Ludwig
took
over
as
regent
By
then
it
had
long
been
apparent
that
Otto
would
never
be
able
to
reign
and
sentiment
grew
for
Ludwig
to
become
king
in
his
own
right
On
6
November
a
year
after
the
Landtag
passed
a
law
allowing
him
to
do
so
Ludwig
ended
the
regency
deposed
Otto
and
declared
himself
King
of
Bavaria
as
Ludwig
III
The
Prinzregentenzeit
prince
s
regent
s
time
as
the
regency
of
Luitpold
is
often
called
was
due
to
the
political
passiveness
of
Luitpold
an
era
of
the
gradual
transfer
of
Bavarian
interests
behind
those
of
the
German
empire
In
connection
with
the
unhappy
end
of
the
preceding
rule
of
King
Ludwig
II
this
break
in
the
Bavarian
monarchy
looked
even
stronger
Finally
the
constitutional
amendment
of
1913
brought
the
determining
break
in
the
continuity
of
the
king
s
rule
in
the
opinion
of
historians
particularly
as
this
change
had
been
granted
by
the
Landtag
as
a
House
of
Representatives
and
meant
therefore
indirectly
the
first
step
from
constitutional
to
the
parliamentary
monarchy
Today
the
connection
of
these
two
developments
is
regarded
as
a
main
cause
for
the
unspectacular
end
of
the
Bavarian
kingdom
without
opposition
in
the
course
of
the
November
revolution
of
1918
However
the
course
of
his
26
year
regency
Luitpold
knew
to
overcome
by
modesty
ability
and
popularity
the
initial
uneasiness
of
his
subjects
These
prince
regent
s
years
were
transfigured
finally
above
all
in
the
retrospect
to
a
golden
age
of
Bavaria
even
if
one
mourned
the
fairy
tale

Ludwig
II

a
folkloric
nostalgic
manner

Military
autonomy
edit
With
the
establishment
of
the
German
Empire
a
series
of
conventions
brought
the
bulk
of
the
various
state
military
forces
directly
under
the
administration
of
the
Prussian
War
Ministry
Bavaria
however
maintained
a
degree
of
autonomy
in
peacetime
with
its
own
two
later
three
army
corps
remaining
outside
the
Prussian
order
of
battle

The
Bavarian
infantry
and
cavalry
regiments
retained
their
historic
light
blue
and
green
uniforms
distinctive
from
the
Prussian
model
adopted
throughout
most
of
the
army
The
individual
Bavarian
soldier
swore
an
oath
of
loyalty
to
King
Ludwig
though
in
wartime
this
pledge
of
obedience
was
extended
to
Kaiser
Wilhelm
as
supreme
commander
In
July
1914
the
Bavarian
Army
numbered
92
400
or
11
percent
of

World

I
and
the
end
of
the

edit
In
1914
a
clash
of
alliances
occurred
over
Austria
Hungary
s
invasion
of
Serbia
following
the
assassination
of
Austrian
Archduke
Franz
Ferdinand
by
a
Bosnian
Serb
militant
Germany
went
to
the
side
of
its

Hungary
and
declared
war
on
France
and
Russia
Following
the
German
invasion
of
neutral
Belgium
the
United
Kingdom
declared
war
on
Germany
Initially
in
Bavaria
and
all
across
Germany
recruits
flocked
enthusiastically
to
the
German
Army
At
the
outbreak
of
World
War
I
King
Ludwig
III
sent
an
official
dispatch
to
Berlin
to
express
Bavaria
s
solidarity
Later
Ludwig
even
claimed
annexations
for
Bavaria
Alsace
citation
needed
and
the
city
of
Antwerp
in

His
hidden
agenda
was
to
maintain
the
balance
of
power
between
Prussia
and
Bavaria
within
the
German
Empire
after
a
victory
Over
time
with
a
stalemated
and
bloody
war
on
the
western
front
Bavarians
like
many
Germans
grew
weary
of
a
continuing

the

became

Accused
of
showing

loyalty
to

Ludwig

became
increasingly
unpopular
during
the
war
In
1918
the
kingdom
attempted
to
negotiate
a
separate
peace
with
the
allies
but
failed
By
1918
civil
unrest
was
spreading
across
Bavaria
and
Germany
Bavarian
defiance
to
Prussian
hegemony
and
Bavarian
separatism
being
key
motivators
On
7
November
1918
Ludwig
fled
from
the
Residenz
Palace
in
Munich
with
his
family
He
was
the
first
of
the
monarchs
in
the
German
Empire
to
be
deposed
A
few
days
later
William
II
abdicated
the
throne
of
Germany
Ludwig
took
up
residence
in
Austria
for
what
was
intended
to
be
a
temporary
stay
On
12
November
he
issued
the
Anif
declaration
which
released
his
soldiers
and
officials
from
their
oath
to
him
Although
he
never
formally
abdicated
the
socialist
led
government
of
Kurt
Eisner
took
Ludwig
s
declaration
as
such
and
declared
the
Wittelsbachs
deposed
With
this
the
700
year
rule
of
the
Wittelsbach
dynasty
came
to
an
end
and
the
former
Kingdom
of
Bavaria
became
the
People
s
State
of
Bavaria
The
funeral
of
Ludwig
III
in
1921
was
feared
or
hoped
to
spark
a
restoration
of
the
monarchy
Despite
the
abolition
of
the
monarchy
the
former
King
was
laid
to
rest
in

of
the
royal
family
the
Bavarian
government
military
personnel
and
an
estimated
100
000
spectators
in

Rupprecht
did
not
wish
to
use
the
occasion
of
the
passing
of

by
force
preferring
to
do
so
by

means
Cardinal

Archbishop
of

in
his
funeral
speech
made
a

In

As

had
been
split
up
in
1815
the
eastern

Heidelberg
was
given

After

History

Earlier
locomotives
in
Germany
edit
The
Adler
is
often
cited
as
the
very
first
locomotive
used
by
a
railway
company
on
German
soil
But
as
early
as
1816
a
serviceable
steam
locomotive
was
designed
by
the
Royal
Prussian
Steelworks
K
niglich
Preu
ische
Eisengie
erei
in
Berlin
During
a
trial
run
this
so
called
Krigar
locomotive
hauled
one
railway
wagon
with
a
payload
of
8
000
German
pounds
about
4
48
tonnes
or
4
41
long
tons
But
this
vehicle
was
never
used
commercially
1
2
Nevertheless
the
Adler
was
undoubtedly
the
first
successfully
operated
locomotive
in
regular
use
in
Germany
Origin
edit
Bill
for
the
Adler
of
the
Bavarian
Ludwig
Railway
issued
by
the
locomotive
factory
Robert
Stephenson
and
Company
on
27
August
1835
During
the
construction
of
the
Bavarian
Ludwig
Railway
founded
by
Georg
Zacharias
Platner
the
search
for
a
suitable
locomotive
started
in
England
The
first
letter
of
enquiry
was
sent
via
the
London
company
Suse
und
Libeth
to
Robert
Stephenson
Co
and
Braithwaite
Ericsson
The
locomotive
was
to
be
able
to
pull
a
weight
of
ten
metric
tons
and
cover
the
distance
between
Nuremberg
and
F
rth
in
a
time
of
eight
to
ten
minutes
Carriages
were
heated
with
charcoal
Stephenson
replied
that
a
locomotive
of
the
same
build
class
as
those
on
the
Liverpool
and
Manchester
Railway
with
four
wheels
and
a
weight
of
between
7
5
and
8
metric
tons
could
be
supplied
A
lighter
engine
would
not
have
the
necessary
power
of
adhesion
and
would
be
more
expensive
than
a
heavier
engine
In
any
case
on
16
June
1833
Johannes
Scharrer
asked
for
a
quote
for
two
locomotives
with
a
weight
of
6
5
metric
tons
and
the
necessary
package
of
accessories
Stephenson
quoted
a
cost
of
about
1
800
pounds
sterling
The
German
company
Holmes
and
Rolandson
from
Unterkochen
near
Aalen
offered
a
steam
locomotive
with
a
power
of
between
two
and
six
horsepower
at
a
price
of
4
500
Gulden
Negotiations
with
Holmes
and
Rolandson
stalled
and
this
avenue
of
enquiry
was
dropped
A
further
bid
came
from
Josef
Reaullaux
located
in
Eschweiler
near
Aachen
At
the
end
of
April
Platner
and
Mainberger
from
Nuremberg
were
in
Neuwied
near
Cologne
There
they
wanted
to
award
a
contract
for
the
railway
track
On
28
April
they
travelled
to
Cologne
to
meet
with
a
friend
of
Platner
called
Consul
Bartls
Bartls
told
them
about
the
Belgian
engineering
works
of
Cockerill
in
Li
ge
As
a
result
Platner
and
Mainberger
travelled
to
Li
ge
There
they
discovered
that
Cockerill
had
not
yet
built
a
locomotive
though
they
did
find
Stephenson
was
in
Brussels
at
that
time
They
reached
Brussels
on
1
May
and
stayed
in
a
guesthouse
in
Flanders
where
Stephenson
and
several
of
his
engineers
were
staying
Stephenson
wanted
to
be
present
at
the
opening
of
the
railway
line
from
Brussels
to
Mechelen
which
was
scheduled
for
5
May
On
3
May
both
parties
signed
a
letter
of
intent
Stephenson
wanted
to
deliver
a
locomotive
of
the
Patentee
type
with
six
wheels
and
a
weight
of
about
six
metric
tons
for
a
price
of
between
750
and
800
pounds
sterling
On
15
May
1835
the
new
locomotive
was
ordered
from
Stephenson
s
locomotive
works
in
Newcastle
upon
Tyne
to
those
specifications
Furthermore
a
tender
for
a
bogie
passenger
coach
and
a
goods
wagon
were
ordered
Later
it
turned
out
that
the
locomotive
would
cost
about
900
pounds
sterling
instead
of
the
sum
quoted
in
Brussels
Stephenson
originally
promised
in
Brussels
that
the
locomotive
would
be
delivered
by
the
end
of
July
to
Rotterdam
3
Different
units
of
measurement
were
used
in
Nuremberg
and
England
the
English
foot
and
the
bavarian
foot
were
different
The
track
gauge
was
predefined
to
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
Stockton
and
Darlington
Railway
which
was
1
435
mm
4
ft
8
1
2
in
Stephenson
persisted
with
this
gauge
which
meant
the
existing
track
had
to
be
relaid
because
its
track
gauge
was
too
narrow
by
5
8
inches
The
delivery
of
the
locomotive
to
Nuremberg
together
with
all
its
spares
comprising
over
100
individual
components
in
19
boxes
with
a
total
weight
of
177
hundredweight
came
to
a
cost
of
1
140
pounds
19
shillings
und
3
pennies
The
boxes
were
shipped
late
on
3
September
1835
on
the
ship
Zoar
from
London
to
Rotterdam
The
freight
rate
from
Rotterdam
to
Cologne
was
700
francs
from
Cologne
to
Offenbach
am
Main
507
South
German
gulden
and
9
kreuzer
and
from
Offenbach
to
Nuremberg
653
gulden
and
11
kreuzer
The
board
of
directors
of
the
Bavarian
Ludwig
Railway
wanted
the
purchase
to
be
exempted
from
import
duty
The
locomotive
was
declared
as
an
item
of
a
formerly
unknown
product
which
was
to
be
used
by
factories
in
the
Bavarian
interior
After
several
difficulties
the
Ministry
of
Finance
approved
the
tax
free
import
with
Johann
Wilhelm
Spaeth
as
the
recipient
of
the
consignment
4
The
transport
boxes
containing
the
locomotive
were
shipped
by
the
barge
van
Hees
owned
by
its
captain
van
Hees
and
pulled
upriver
by
the
steamboat
Hercules
on
the
Rhine
until
it
reached
Cologne
5
As
the
waterline
in
the
Rhine
was
low
Captain
van
Hees
had
to
use
horses
to
pull
the
barge
instead
of
the
steamboat
as
originally
planned
4
On
7
October
the
train
of
barges
reached
Cologne
the
remaining
distance
to
Nuremberg
had
to
be
covered
by
road
because
the
Main
was
too
shallow
to
be
navigable
by
barge
The
transport
on
land
was
disrupted
by
a
strike
of
the
freight
forwarders
in
Offenbach
am
Main
and
a
different
freight
forwarder
had
to
be
ordered
On
26
October
1835
the
transport
reached
Nuremberg
The
steam
engine
was
assembled
in
the
workshops
of
the
Johann
Wilhelm
Spaeth
engineering
works
with
the
assembly
being
observed
by
Stephenson
s
engineer
William
Wilson
who
had
travelled
with
the
locomotive
to
Nuremberg
They
used
the
help
of
the
technical
teacher
Bauer
and
local
carpenters
On
10
November
1835
the
board
of
directors
of
the
Bavarian
Ludwig
Railway
expressed
their
hope
that
the
locomotive
would
be
serviceable
soon
4
The
locomotive
was
a
symbol
for
power
daringness
and
rapidity

turned
out
as
too
heavy
for
use
at
Nuremberg
The
German
constructor
Denis
had
planned
that
the
railway
wagons
should
be
pulled
either
from
the
steam
locomotive
or
from
horses
making
a
lighter
construction
necessary
Several
companies
built
the
wagons
the
bogies
were
produced
by
Sp
th
Gemeiner
und
Manhard
the
wooden
coachwork
were
delivered
by
the
wheelwright
Stahl
from
Nuremberg
As
these
companies
were
used
to
capacity
with
different
orders
three
bogies
and
16
wheels
were
produced
by
the
company
Stein
in
Lohr
near
Aschaffenburg
Denis
threatened
these
companies
to
place
future
orders
in
England
if
they
would
not
work
faster
At
the
end
of
August
1835
the
first
wagon
was
completed
In
the
second
half
of
October
that
year
the
further
wagons
were
nearing
completion
with
nine
wagons
produced
before
the
opening
of
the
Bavarian
Ludwig
Railway
The
wagons
consisted
of
two
wagons
for
third
class
passengers
four
for
second
class
and
three
for
first
class
On
21
October
1835
the
first
test
run
with
one
horse
pulled
wagon
took
place
Denis
had
constructed
a
brake
for
the
wagons
which
was
tested
at
this
opportunity
The
wagon
could
be
stopped
in
each
situation
without
any
effort
by
the
horse
On
16
November
the
first
test
run
of
the
steam
locomotive
from
Nuremberg
to
F
rth
and
back
again
was
accomplished
Due
to
the
cold
weather
that
day
the
speed
was
slowed
down
Three
days
later
five
fully
occupied
wagons
were
transported
on
the
track
in
between
12
and
13
minutes
On
the
way
back
the
brakes
and
also
boarding
and
disembarking
of
the
passengers
were
tested
During
the
following
tests
it
was
discovered
if
wood
was
burned
in
the
locomotive
the
sparks
which
came
out
of
the
chimney
of
the
locomotive
singed
the
clothing
of
the
passengers
The
participation
at
the
test
run
costed
36
kreuzers
and
the
revenues
from
this
were
donated
to
the
welfare
of
the
poor

The
Adler
was
built
on
a
wooden
framework
which
was
covered
with
sheet
metal
Both
wet
steam
driven
cylinders
were
placed
horizontally
inside
the
frame
and
drove
the
driving
wheelset
which
was
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
three
axles
The
driving
wheels
had
no
wheel
flange
so
the
locomotive
could
be
operated
on
small
radius
curves
The
forged
spokes
were
rivetted
to
the
rim
The
original
wheels
were
made
of
cast
iron
and
were
encircled
with
a
forged
tyre
made
of
wrought
iron
The
original
wheels
made
of
brittle
cast
iron
were
replaced
later
through
wheels
made
of
wrought
iron
The
hollow
spokes
had
a
core
made
of
wood
to
make
them
more
flexible
to
cushion
unevenness
of
the
track
All
wheels
of
the
locomotive
were
unbraked
A
mechanical
railway
brake
braked
both
wheels
of
the
tender
on
the
right
side
where
the
fireman
was
located
There
was
a
fixed
connection
between
the
locomotive
and
the
tender
The
buffers
were
made
of
wood
The
horseshoe
shaped
water
box
surrounded
the
coal
stored
in

coke
was
burned
in

The
passenger
wagons
had
the
same
bodies
that
were
used
for
horse
drawn
carriages
They
were
mounted
on
a
bogie
made
of
iron
The
shape
of
coup
carriages
with
two
axles
and
three
separated
compartments
in
line
was
the
archetype
for
the
first
German
railway
wagons
Specific
bogies
for
passenger
coaches
were
first
developed
in
1842
by
the
Great
Western
Railway
All
wagons
were
painted
in
yellow
which
was
the
colour
of
stagecoaches
at
that
time
The
third
class
wagons
originally
had
no
roof
three
compartments
with
eight
to
ten
seats
and
the
entrances
had
no
doors
The
second
class
wagons
had
originally
a
roof
made
of
canvas
had
doors
unglazed
windows
and
curtains
originally
made
of
silk
later
made
of
leather
All
wagons
were
of
the
same
width
but
from
the
cheapest
to
the
most
expensive
class
the
number
of
seats
in
one
line
were
reduced
by
one
The
first
class
wagons
were
lined
with
a
precious
blue
foulard
had
windows
made
of
glass
the
door
handles
gilded
and
all
metal
fittings
were
made

the

driven
by
William
Wilson
ran
for
the
first
time
on
the
6
05
kilometres
long
track
of
the

in
nine
minutes
200
guests
of
honour
were
on
the
train
and
26
year
old
Scotsman
William
Wilson
was
in
the
cab
In
time
intervals
of
two
hours
two
more
test
runs
were
made
The
locomotive
was
in
use
with
up
to
nine
wagons
with
192
passengers
as
a
maximum
In
normal
use
it
drove
at
a
maximum
speed
of
28
km
h
because
the
locomotive
should
be
preserved
The
normal
run
time
was
about
14
minutes
Demonstration
trial
could
be
done
at
a
maximum
speed
of
65
km
h
In
most
cases
horses
were
used
as
working
animals
instead
of
the
steam
locomotive
Because
the
coal
was
first
very
expensive
most
services
were
done
as
a
horsecar
Goods
were
transported
additionally
to
the
passengers
beginning
from
the
year
1839
One
of
the
first
goods
which
were
transported
were
beer
barrels
and
cattle
In
1845
there
was
a
considerable
transport
of
goods
After
running
successfully
for
twenty
two
years
the
Adler
was
now
the
weakest
locomotive
on
the
European
continent
Moreover
the
consumption
of
coal
of
newer
steam
engines
was
much
more
efficient
until
then
The
locomotive
was
used
in
Nuremberg
as
a
stationary
steam
engine
1858
the
railway
company
sold
the
locomotive
with
the
tender
but
minus
its
wheels
and
further
accessories
to
the
iron
dealer

Director
Riedinger
located
in

Adler
1935
replica
in
Nuremberg
in
1999
In
1925
the
establishment
of
the
Nuremberg
Transport
Museum
was
planned
The
Adler
which
was
scrapped
in
the
past
should
be
reconstructed
The
exact
plans
of
that
year
were
lost
until
now
Only
one
engraving
on
the
time
of
the
historical
Adler
provided
information
1929
these
plans
were
stopped
by
the
Great
Depression
To
celebrate
the
centenary
of
the
railways
in
Germany
in
1935
a
replica
of
the
Adler
was
built
beginning
from
1933
by
the
Deutsche
Reichsbahn
in
the
Kaiserslautern
repair
shop
Ausbesserungswerk
which
was
largely
true
to
the
original
The
original
idea
of
the
President
of
the
Reichsbahn
Julius
Dorpm
ller
and
the
members
of
his
staff
was
to
use
the
Adler
replica
as
an
instrument
of
propaganda
for
the
new
era
in
the
city
of
the
Reichsparteitag
Nuremberg
They
planned
to
contrast
the
Adler
with
modern
gigantic
steam
locomotives
like
the
high
speed
DRG
Class
05
For
the
realisation
of
the
replica
they
used
the
results
of
the
planning
in
1925
Besides
of
different
technical
data
the
replica
differed
from
the
original
with
thicker
boiler
casing
and
additional
cross
bracings
and
spokes
wheels
made
of
steel
12
The
replica
attained
an
average
speed
of
33
7
km
h
in
tests
on
an
81
kilometre
stretch
of
line
The
route
had
gradients
of
between
1
110
and
1
140
From
14
July
until
13
October
1935
visitors
could
travel
with
the
reconstructed
Adler
train
on
a
track
length
of
two
kilometres
on
the
area
of
the
centenary
exhibition
in
Nuremberg
On
the
driving
cab
were
also
the
President
of
the
Deutsche
Reichsbahn
Julius
Dorpm
ller
and
the
Gauleiter
of
Franconia
Julius
Streicher
The
Adler
replica
was
in
use
after
that
in
1936
at
the
Cannstatter
Wasen
in
Stuttgart
and
during
the
1936
Summer
Olympics
in
Berlin
During
the
100
years
jubilee
of
the
first
prussian
railway
in
1938
the
Adler
train
was
in
service
between
Berlin
and
Potsdam
After
this
event
the
Adler
train
was
sent
to
the
Nuremberg
Transport
Museum
In
1950
the
Adler
train
was
displayed
by
the
Deutsche
Bundesbahn
on
a
street
transport
vehicle
for
rolling
stock
during
a
parade
of
the
900
years
jubilee
of
Nuremberg
13
For
the
125th
anniversary
of
the
railway
in
Germany
the
Adler
train
was
in
service
on
the
track
of
the
tram
between
Nuremberg
Pl
rrer
place
and
F
rth
Hauptbahnhof
The
inner
sides
of
the
wheels
were
needed
to
turned
of
for
operating
on
the
tram
track
14
In
1984
it
was
rebuilt
for
the
150th
anniversary
by
the
Deutsche
Bundesbahn
in
the
Offenburg
repair
shop
The
inner
sides
of
the
wheels
which
were
turned
of
in
1960
for
driving
on
a
tram
track
had
to
welded
again
The
steam
boiler
was
checked
under
notice
of
current
safety
regulations
The
Adler
was
displayed
on
the
great
jubilee
exhibition
in
Nuremberg
and
took
part
of
numerous
events
in
west
Germany
like
for
example
in
Hamburg
Konstanz
and
Munich
On
22
May
1984
it
was
used
for
public
tours
between
N
rnberg
Hauptbahnhof
and
Nuremberg
East
15
The
locomotive
wasn
t
in
service
from
1985
until
1999
For
the
planned
services
in
1999
it
had
to
be
refurbished
during
several
months
On
16
September
1999
the
Federal
Railway
Authority
gave
the
approval
of
operation

For
the
100th
anniversary
of
the
Bavarian
Railway
Museum
and
the
successor
Nuremberg
Transport
Museum
in
1999
the
Adler
train
was
in
service
at
three
Sundays
in
October
and
took
part
in
the
great
parade
of
rolling
stock
at
the
Nuremberg
classification
yard
In
the
following
years
the
Adler
train
was
used
for
several
classic
railway
tours
in
Germany
17
It
stood
in
the
Nuremberg
Transport
Museum
until
2005
when
it
was
damaged
by
fire
18
At
a
fire
in
the
museum
s
roundhouse
at
the
Nuremberg
West
locomotive
depot
on
17
October
2005
which
at
that
time
contained
24
locomotives
the
still
working
Adler
replica
was
one
of
many
engines
that
were
badly
damaged
Nevertheless
the
management
of
the
Deutsche
Bahn
decided
to
restore
it
The
wreck
was
lifted
from
the
ruins
of
the
roundhouse
on
7
November
by
a
mobile
crane
in
a
four
hour
operation
by
a
recovery
gang
from
the
Pre
nitz
Valley
Railway
and
taken
by
special
low
loader
to
the
Meiningen
Steam
Locomotive
Works
It
was
discovered
that
the
boiler
at
least
thanks
to
its
being
full
of
water
was
relatively
undamaged
although
its
entire
wooden
cladding
had
been
burnt
and
many
plates
had
melted
and
it
could
therefore
be
used
for
the
reconstruction
in
2007

The
reconstruction
started
in
mid
April
2007
and
was
finished
by
the
October
19
20
The
metal
sheathed
wooden
frame
was
however
so
badly
damaged
that
it
had
to
be
completely
built
from
scratch
A
third
class
wagon
that
had
been
stored
at
a
different
location
and
so
had
survived
the
fire
served
as
a
template
for
the
new
coach
like
wagons
that
were
built
by
a
Meiningen
carpenter
s
shop
The
cost
ran
to
about
a
million
euros
of
which
200
000
euros
was
donated
by
the
public
21
The
director
of
the
DB
Museum
Nuremberg
assuaged
fears
before
the
reconstruction
began
that
the
rebuilding
work
would
not
be
able
to
replicate
the
details
of
the
locomotive
damaged
by
the
fire
and
explained
No
compromises
will
be
made
It
was
even
more
accurately
built
by
using
historical
drawings
so
for
example
the
reconstruction
of
the
chimney
damaged
in
the
fire
was
not
based
on
the
1935
replica
but
on
the
original
design
The
biggest
problem
was
the
one
piece
driving
axle
This
could
not
be
made
in
the
Meiningen
works
so
at
short
notice
the
company
Gr
dlitzer
Kurbelwelle
Wildau
GmbH
was
found
which
could
carry
out
the
work
For
the
frame
of
the
locomotive
between
eight
and
twelve
years
seasoned
wood
from
fraxinus
trees
was
used
This
was
flexible
enough
for
vibrations
by
the
power
transmission
during
a
run
The
base
frame
of
the
tender
was
built
from
hard
wood
taken
from
oak
trees
22
On
23
November
2007
the
restored
Adler
returned
to

was
a
French
military
and
political
leader
who
rose
to
prominence
during
the
French
Revolution
and
led
several
successful
campaigns
during
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
As
Napoleon
I
he
was
Emperor
of
the
French
from
1804
until
1814
and
again
briefly
in
1815
during
the
Hundred
Days
Napoleon
dominated
European
and
global
affairs
for
more
than
a
decade
while
leading
France
against
a
series
of
coalitions
in
the
Napoleonic
Wars
He
won
most
of
these
wars
and
the
vast
majority
of
his
battles
building
a
large
empire
that
ruled
over
continental
Europe
before
its
final
collapse
in
1815
One
of
the
greatest
commanders
in
history
his
wars
and
campaigns
are
studied
at
military
schools
worldwide
Napoleon
s
political
and
cultural
legacy
has
endured
as
one
of
the
most
celebrated
and
controversial
leaders
in
human
history

He
was
born
Napoleone
di
Buonaparte
Italian
napole
o
ne
di
bw
na
parte
in
Corsica
to
a
relatively
modest
family
from
minor
Italian
nobility
When
the
Revolution
broke
out
in
1789
Napoleon
was
serving
as
an
artillery
officer
in
the
French
army
Seizing
the
new
opportunities
presented
by
the
Revolution
he
rapidly
rose
through
the
ranks
of
the
military
becoming
a
general
at
age
24
The
Directory
eventually
gave
him
command
of
the
Army
of
Italy
after
he
suppressed
a
revolt
against
the
government
from
royalist
insurgents
At
age
26
he
began
his
first
military
campaign
against
the
Austrians
and
their
Italian
allies
winning
virtually
every
battle
conquering
the
Italian
Peninsula
in
a
year
and
becoming
a
national
hero
In
1798
he
led
a
military
expedition
to
Egypt
that
served
as
a
springboard
to
political
power
He
engineered
a
coup
in
November
1799
and
became
First
Consul
of
the
Republic
His
ambition
and
public
approval
inspired
him
to
go
further
and
in
1804
he
became
the
first
Emperor
of
the
French
Intractable
differences
with
the
British
meant
that
the
French
were
facing
a
Third
Coalition
by
1805
Napoleon
shattered
this
coalition
with
decisive
victories
in
the
Ulm
Campaign
and
a
historic
triumph
over
Russia
and
Austria
at
the
Battle
of
Austerlitz
which
led
to
the
elimination
of
the
thousand
year
old
Holy
Roman
Empire
In
1806
the
Fourth
Coalition
took
up
arms
against
him
because
Prussia
became
worried
about
growing
French
influence
on
the
continent
Napoleon
quickly
defeated
Prussia
at
the
battles
of
Jena
and
Auerstedt
then
marched
the
Grand
Army
deep
into
Eastern
Europe
and
annihilated
the
Russians
in
June
1807
at
the
Battle
of
Friedland
France
then
forced
the
defeated
nations
of
the
Fourth
Coalition
to
sign
the
Treaties
of
Tilsit
in
July
1807
bringing
an
uneasy
peace
to
the
continent
Tilsit
signified
the
high
watermark
of
the
French
Empire
In
1809
the
Austrians
and
the
British
challenged
the
French
again
during
the
War
of
the
Fifth
Coalition
but
Napoleon
solidified
his
grip
over
Europe
after
triumphing
at
the
Battle
of
Wagram
in
July
Hoping
to
extend
the
Continental
System
and
choke
off
British
trade
with
the
European
mainland
Napoleon
invaded
Iberia
and
declared
his
brother
Joseph
the
King
of
Spain
in
1808
The
Spanish
and
the
Portuguese
revolted
with
British
support
The
Peninsular
War
lasted
six
years
featured
extensive
guerrilla
warfare
and
ended
in
victory
for
the
Allies
The
Continental
System
caused
recurring
diplomatic
conflicts
between
France
and
its
client
states
especially
Russia
Unwilling
to
bear
the
economic
consequences
of
reduced
trade
the
Russians
routinely
violated
the
Continental
System
and
enticed
Napoleon
into
another
war
The
French
launched
a
major
invasion
of
Russia
in
the
summer
of
1812
The
resulting
campaign
witnessed
the
collapse
of
the
Grand
Army
and
the
destruction
of
Russian
cities
and
inspired
a
renewed
push
against
Napoleon
by
his
enemies
In
1813
Prussia
and
Austria
joined
Russian
forces
in
a
Sixth
Coalition
against
France
A
lengthy
military
campaign
culminated
in
a
large
Allied
army
defeating
Napoleon
at
the
Battle
of
Leipzig
in
October
1813
The
Allies
then
invaded
France
and
captured
Paris
in
the
spring
of
1814
forcing
Napoleon
to
abdicate
in
April
He
was
exiled
to
the
island
of
Elba
near
Rome

However
Napoleon
escaped

The

responded
by
forming

Napoleon

bringing
liberal
reforms
to
the
numerous
territories
that
he
conquered
and
controlled
such
as
the
Low

large
parts
of

He
implemented
fundamental
liberal
policies
in
France
and
throughout

and
was
named
Corsica
s
representative
to
the
court
of
Louis

The
dominant
influence
of
Napoleon
s
childhood
was
his
mother
Letizia
Ramolino
whose
firm
discipline
restrained
a
rambunctious
child

Napoleon
s
maternal
grandmother
had
married
into
the
Swiss
Fesch
family
in
her
second
marriage
and
Napoleon
s
uncle
the
cardinal
Joseph
Fesch
would
fulfill
a
role
as
protector
of
the
Bonaparte
family
for
some
years
He
had
an
elder

were
born
before
Joseph
but
died
in
infancy
Napoleon
was
baptised
as
a
Catholic

Napoleon
s
noble
moderately
affluent
background
afforded
him
greater
opportunities
to
study
than
were
available
to
a
typical
Corsican
of
the
time
20
In
January
1779
he
was
enrolled
at
a
religious
school
in
Autun
In
May
he
was
admitted
to
a
military
academy
at
Brienne
le
Ch

21
His
first
language
was
Corsican
and
he
always
spoke
French
with
a
marked
Corsican
accent
and
never
learned
to
spell
French
properly
22
He
was
teased
by
other
students
for
his
accent
and
applied
himself
to
reading
23
An

observed
that
Napoleon
has
always
been
distinguished
for
his
application
in

He
is

and
took
nearly
two

Paris
during
this

At
this
time
he
was
a

Mus

Paris
Two
days
after
the
marriage
Bonaparte
left
Paris
to
take
command
of
the
Army
of
Italy
He
immediately
went
on
the
offensive
hoping
to
defeat
the
forces
of
Piedmont
before
their
Austrian
allies
could
intervene
In
a
series
of
rapid
victories
during
the
Montenotte
Campaign
he
knocked
Piedmont
out
of
the
war
in
two
weeks
The
French
then
focused
on
the
Austrians
for
the
remainder
of
the
war
the
highlight
of
which
became
the
protracted
struggle
for
Mantua
The
Austrians
launched
a
series
of
offensives
against
the
French
to
break
the
siege
but
Napoleon
defeated
every
relief
effort
scoring
victories
at
the
battles
of
Castiglione
Bassano
Arcole
and
Rivoli
The
decisive
French
triumph
at
Rivoli
in
January
1797
led
to
the
collapse
of
the
Austrian
position
in
Italy
At
Rivoli
the
Austrians
lost
up
to
14
000
men
while
the
French
lost
about
5
000
50
The
next
phase
of
the
campaign
featured
the
French
invasion
of
the
Habsburg
heartlands
French
forces
in
Southern
Germany
had
been
defeated
by
the
Archduke
Charles
in
1796
but
the
Archduke
withdrew
his
forces
to
protect
Vienna
after
learning
about
Napoleon
s
assault
In
the
first
encounter
between
the
two
commanders
Napoleon
pushed
back
his
opponent
and
advanced
deep
into
Austrian
territory
after
winning
at
the
Battle
of
Tarvis
in
March
1797
The
Austrians
were
alarmed
by
the
French
thrust
that
reached
all
the
way
to
Leoben
about
100
km
from
Vienna
and
finally
decided
to
sue
for
peace
51
The
Treaty
of
Leoben
followed
by
the
more
comprehensive
Treaty
of
Campo
Formio
gave
France
control
of
most
of
northern
Italy
and
the
Low
Countries
and
a
secret
clause
promised
the
Republic
of
Venice
to
Austria
Bonaparte
marched
on
Venice
and
forced
its
surrender
ending
1
100
years
of
independence
He
also
authorized
the
French
to
loot
treasures
such
as
the
Horses
of
Saint
Mark
52
His
application
of
conventional
military
ideas
to
real
world
situations
enabled
his
military
triumphs
such
as
creative
use
of
artillery
as
a
mobile
force
to
support
his
infantry
He
stated
later
in
life
when
I
have
fought
sixty
battles
and
I
have
learned
nothing
which
I
did
not
know
at
the
beginning
Look
at
Caesar
he
fought
the
first
like
the
last
53
Bonaparte
could
win
battles
by
concealment
of
troop
deployments
and
concentration
of
his
forces
on
the
hinge
of
an
enemy
s
weakened
front
If
he
could
not
use
his
favourite
envelopment
strategy
he
would
take
up
the
central
position
and
attack
two
co
operating
forces
at
their
hinge
swing
round
to
fight
one
until
it
fled
then
turn
to
face
the
other
54
In
this
Italian
campaign
Bonaparte
s
army
captured
150
000
prisoners
540
cannons
and
170
standards
55
The
French
army
fought
67
actions
and
won
18
pitched
battles
through
superior
artillery
technology
and
Bonaparte
s
tactics
56
During
the
campaign
Bonaparte
became
increasingly
influential
in
French
politics
He
founded
two
newspapers
one
for
the
troops
in
his
army
and
another
for

After

months
of

Bonaparte
decided
that

s
naval
power
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
confront
the
British

He
decided
on
a

to
seize
Egypt
and
thereby
undermine
Britain
s
access
to

33
Bonaparte
wished
to
establish
a
French
presence
in
the
Middle
East
with
the
ultimate
dream
of
linking
with
Tipu
Sultan
a
Muslim
enemy
of
the
British
in
India
61
Napoleon
assured
the
Directory
that
as
soon
as
he
had
conquered
Egypt
he
will
establish
relations
with
the
Indian
princes
and
together
with
them
attack
the

The

agreed
in

attack
on
Jaffa
was

brutal
Bonaparte
discovered
that
many
of
the
defenders
were
former
prisoners

ostensibly
on
parole
so
he
ordered
the
garrison
and
1
400
prisoners
to
be
executed

To

In
the
spring
of

Napoleon
and
his
troops
crossed
the
Swiss
Alps
into
Italy
aiming
to
surprise
the
Austrian
armies
that
had
reoccupied
the
peninsula
when
Napoleon
was
still
in
Egypt
note

After
a
difficult
crossing
over
the
Alps
the
French
army
entered
the
plains
of
Northern
Italy
virtually
unopposed
82
While
one
French
army
approached
from
the
north
the
Austrians
were
busy
with
another
stationed
in
Genoa
which
was
besieged
by
a
substantial
force
The
fierce
resistance
of
this
French
army
under
Andr
Mass
na
gave
the
northern
force
some
time
to
carry
out
their
operations
with
little
interference
83
After
spending
several
days
looking
for
each
other
the
two
armies
collided
at
the
Battle
of
Marengo
on
14
June
General
Melas
had
a
numerical
advantage
fielding
about
30
000
Austrian
soldiers
while
Napoleon
commanded
24
000
French
troops
84
The
battle
began
favorably
for
the
Austrians
as
their
initial
attack
surprised
the
French
and
gradually
drove
them
back
Melas
stated
that
he
d
won
the
battle
and
retired
to
his
headquarters
around
3
pm
leaving
his
subordinates
in
charge
of
pursuing
the
French
85
The
French
lines
never
broke
during
their
tactical
retreat
Napoleon
constantly
rode
out
among
the
troops
urging
them
to
stand
and
fight
Late
in
the
afternoon
when
a
full
division
under
Desaix
arrived
on
the
field
and
reversed
the
tide
of
the
battle
A
series
of
artillery
barrages
and
cavalry
charges
decimated
the
Austrian
army
which
fled
over
the
Bormida
River
back
to
Alessandria
leaving
behind
14

The
following
day
when
the
Austrian
army
agreed
to
abandon
Northern
Italy

more
with
the
Convention
of
Alessandria
which
granted
them
safe
passage
to
friendly
soil
in
exchange
for
their
fortresses
throughout
the
region
86
Although
critics
have
blamed
Napoleon
for
several
tactical
mistakes
preceding
the
battle
they
have
also
praised
his
audacity
for
selecting
a
risky
campaign
strategy
choosing
to
invade
the
Italian
peninsula
from
the
north
when
the
vast
majority
of
French
invasions
came
from

almost
a
year

out

only

him
harmless

attaining
the
object
of
the

North
Italy
88
Napoleon
s
triumph
at
Marengo
secured
his
political
authority
and
boosted
his
popularity
back
home
but
it
did
not
lead
to
an
immediate
peace
Bonaparte
s
brother
Joseph
led
the
complex
negotiations
in
Lun

and
reported
that
Austria
emboldened
by
British
support
would
not
acknowledge
the
new
territory
that
France
had
acquired
As
negotiations
became
increasingly
fractious
Bonaparte
gave
orders
to
his
general
Moreau
to
strike
Austria
once
more
Moreau
and
the
French
swept
through
Bavaria
and
scored
an
overwhelming
victory
at
Hohenlinden
in
December
1800
As
a
result
the
Austrians
capitulated
and
signed
the

of
political
autonomy
during
the
Revolutionary
Wars
with
Toussaint
Louverture
installing
himself

by

Napoleon
saw
his
chance
to
recuperate
the
formerly
wealthy
colony
when
he
signed
the
Treaty
of
Amiens
During
the
Revolution
the
National
Convention
voted
to
abolish
slavery
in
February
1794
Under
the
terms
of
Amiens
however
Napoleon
agreed
to
appease
British
demands
by
not
abolishing
slavery
in
any
colonies
where
the
1794
decree
had
never
been
implemented
The
resulting
Law
of
20
May
never
applied
to
colonies
like
Guadeloupe
or
Guyane
even
though
rogue
generals
and
other
officials
used
the
pretext
of
peace
as
an
opportunity
to
reinstate
slavery
in
some
of
these
places
The
Law
of
20
May
officially
restored
the
slave
trade
to

colonies
not

itself

Leclerc
designed
to
reassert
control
over
Sainte

Although
the

managed
to
capture
Toussaint
Louverture
the
expedition
failed

Neither

expand
his
power
Napoleon
used
these
assassination
plots
to
justify
the
creation
of
an
imperial
system
based
on
the
Roman
model
He
believed
that
a
Bourbon
restoration
would
be
more
difficult
if
his
family
s
succession
was
entrenched
in
the
constitution

As
with
the
Life

A
keen
observer
of
Bonaparte
s
rise
to
absolute
power
Madame

R
musat
explains
that
men
worn
out
by
the
turmoil
of
the
Revolution
looked
for
the
domination
of
an
able
ruler
and
that
people
believed
quite
sincerely
that
Bonaparte
whether
as
consul
or
emperor
would
exert
his
authority
and
save
them
from
the
perils
of

Napoleon
s
coronation
took
place
on
2
December
1804
Two
separate
crowns
were
brought
for
the
ceremony
a
golden
laurel
wreath
recalling
the
Roman
Empire
and
a
replica
of
Charlemagne
s
crown
102
Napoleon
entered
the
ceremony
wearing
the
laurel
wreath
and
kept
it
on
his
head
throughout
the
proceedings
102
For
the
official
coronation
he
raised
the
Charlemagne
crown
over
his
own
head
in
a
symbolic
gesture
but
never
placed
it
on
top
because
he
was
already
wearing
the
golden
wreath
102
Instead
he
placed
the
crown
on
Josephine
s
head

soldiers
to
60

Great

had
broken
the
Peace
of
Amiens
by
declaring
war
on
France
in
May
1803
103
In
December
1804
an
Anglo
Swedish
agreement
became
the
first
step
towards
the
creation
of
the
Third
Coalition
By
April
1805
Britain
had
also
signed
an
alliance
with
Russia
104
Austria
had
been
defeated
by
France
twice
in
recent
memory
and
wanted
revenge
so
it
joined
the
coalition
a
few
months
later
105
Before
the
formation
of
the
Third
Coalition
Napoleon
had
assembled
an
invasion
force
the
Arm
e
d
Angleterre
around
six
camps
at
Boulogne
in
Northern
France
He
intended
to
use
this
invasion
force
to
strike
at
England
They
never
invaded
but
Napoleon
s
troops
received
careful
and
invaluable
training
for
future
military
operations
106
The
men
at
Boulogne
formed
the
core
for
what
Napoleon
later
called
La
Grande
Arm
e
At
the
start
this
French
army
had
about
200
000
men
organized
into
seven
corps
which
were
large
field
units
that
contained
36
to
40
cannons
each
and
were
capable
of
independent
action
until
other
corps
could
come
to
the
rescue
107
A
single
corps
properly
situated
in
a
strong
defensive
position
could
survive
at
least
a
day
without
support
giving
the
Grande
Arm
e
countless
strategic
and
tactical
options
on
every
campaign
On
top
of
these
forces
Napoleon
created
a
cavalry
reserve
of
22
000
organized
into
two
cuirassier
divisions
four
mounted
dragoon
divisions
one
division
of
dismounted
dragoons
and
one
of
light
cavalry
all
supported
by
24
artillery
pieces
108
By
1805
the
Grande
Arm
e
had
grown
to
a
force
of
350
000
men
108
who
were
well
equipped
well
trained
and
led
by
competent
officers
109
Napoleon
knew
that
the
French
fleet
could
not
defeat
the
Royal
Navy
in
a
head
to
head
battle
so
he
planned
to
lure
it
away
from
the
English
Channel
through
diversionary
tactics
110
The
main
strategic
idea
involved
the
French
Navy
escaping
from
the
British
blockades
of
Toulon
and
Brest
and
threatening
to
attack
the
West
Indies
In
the
face
of
this
attack
it
was
hoped
the
British
would
weaken
their
defense
of
the
Western
Approaches
by
sending
ships
to
the
Caribbean
allowing
a
combined
Franco
Spanish
fleet
to
take
control
of
the
channel
long
enough
for
French
armies
to
cross
and
invade
110
However
the
plan
unraveled
after
the
British
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Cape
Finisterre
in
July
1805
French
Admiral
Villeneuve
then
retreated
to
C
diz
instead
of
linking
up
with
French
naval
forces
at
Brest
for
an
attack
on
the
English
Channel
111
By
August
1805
Napoleon
had
realized
that
the
strategic
situation
had
changed
fundamentally
Facing
a
potential
invasion
from
his
continental
enemies
he
decided
to
strike
first
and
turned
his
army
s
sights
from
the
English
Channel
to
the
Rhine
His
basic
objective
was
to
destroy
the
isolated
Austrian
armies
in
Southern
Germany
before
their
Russian
allies
could
arrive
On
25
September
after
great
secrecy
and
feverish
marching
200
000
French
troops
began
to
cross
the
Rhine
on
a
front
of
260

Austrian
commander
Karl
Mack
had
gathered
the
greater
part
of
the
Austrian
army
at
the
fortress
of
Ulm
in
Swabia
Napoleon
swung
his
forces
to
the
southeast
and
the
Grande
Arm
e
performed
an
elaborate
wheeling
movement
that
outflanked
the
Austrian
positions
The
Ulm
Maneuver
completely
surprised
General
Mack
who
belatedly
understood
that
his
army
had
been
cut
off
After
some
minor
engagements
that
culminated
in
the
Battle
of
Ulm
Mack
finally
surrendered
after
realizing
that
there
was
no
way
to
break
out
of
the
French
encirclement
For
just
2
000
French
casualties
Napoleon
had
managed
to
capture
a
total
of
60
000
Austrian
soldiers
through
his
army
s
rapid
marching
114
The
Ulm
Campaign
is
generally
regarded
as
a
strategic
masterpiece
and
was
influential
in
the
development
of
the
Schlieffen
Plan
in
the
late
19th
century
115
For
the
French
this
spectacular
victory
on
land
was
soured
by
the
decisive
victory
that
the
Royal
Navy
attained
at
the
Battle
of
Trafalgar
on

Napoleon
at
the
Battle
of
Austerlitz
by
Fran
ois
G
rard
1805
The
Battle
of
Austerlitz
also
known
as
the
Battle
of
the
Three
Emperors
was
one
of
Napoleon
s
many
victories
where
the
French
Empire
defeated
the
Third
Coalition
Following
the
Ulm
Campaign
French
forces
managed
to
capture
Vienna
in
November
The
fall
of
Vienna
provided
the
French
a
huge
bounty
as
they
captured
100
000
muskets
500
cannons
and
the
intact
bridges
across
the
Danube
116
At
this
critical
juncture
both
Tsar
Alexander
I
and
Holy
Roman
Emperor
Francis
II
decided
to
engage
Napoleon
in
battle
despite
reservations
from
some
of
their
subordinates
Napoleon
sent
his
army
north
in
pursuit
of
the
Allies
but
then
ordered
his
forces
to
retreat
so
that
he
could
feign
a
grave
weakness
Desperate
to
lure
the
Allies
into
battle
Napoleon
gave
every
indication
in
the
days
preceding
the
engagement
that
the
French
army
was
in
a
pitiful
state
even
abandoning
the
dominant
Pratzen
Heights
near
the
village
of
Austerlitz
At
the
Battle
of
Austerlitz
in
Moravia
on
2
December
he
deployed
the
French
army
below
the
Pratzen
Heights
and
deliberately
weakened
his
right
flank
enticing
the
Allies
to
launch
a
major
assault
there
in
the
hopes
of
rolling
up
the
whole
French
line
A
forced
march
from
Vienna
by
Marshal
Davout
and
his
III
Corps
plugged
the
gap
left
by
Napoleon
just
in
time
Meanwhile
the
heavy
Allied
deployment
against
the
French
right
weakened
their
center
on
the
Pratzen
Heights
which
was
viciously
attacked
by
the
IV
Corps
of
Marshal
Soult
With
the
Allied
center
demolished
the
French
swept
through
both
enemy
flanks
and
sent
the
Allies
fleeing
chaotically
capturing
thousands
of
prisoners
in
the
process
The
battle
is
often
seen
as
a
tactical
masterpiece
because
of
the
near
perfect
execution
of
a
calibrated
but
dangerous
plan
of
the
same
stature
as
Cannae
the
celebrated
triumph
by
Hannibal
some
2
000
years
before

The
Allied
disaster
at
Austerlitz
significantly
shook
the
faith
of
Emperor
Francis
in
the
British
led
war
effort
France
and
Austria
agreed
to
an
armistice
immediately
and
the
Treaty
of
Pressburg
followed
shortly
after
on
26
December
Pressburg
took
Austria
out
of
both
the
war
and
the
Coalition
while
reinforcing
the
earlier
treaties
of
Campo
Formio
and
of
Lun
ville
between
the
two
powers
The
treaty
confirmed
the
Austrian
loss
of
lands
to
France
in
Italy
and
Bavaria
and
lands
in
Germany
to
Napoleon
s
German
allies
It
also
imposed
an
indemnity
of
40
million
francs
on
the
defeated
Habsburgs
and
allowed
the
fleeing
Russian
troops
free
passage
through
hostile
territories
and
back
to
their
home
soil
Napoleon
went
on
to
say
The
battle
of
Austerlitz
is
the
finest
of
all
I
have
fought
118
Frank
McLynn
suggests
that
Napoleon
was
so
successful
at
Austerlitz
that
he
lost
touch
with
reality
and
what
used
to
be
French
foreign
policy
became

that

ambitious

troops

As
in
previous
campaigns
his
fundamental
objective
was
to
destroy
one
opponent
before
reinforcements
from
another
could
tip
the
balance
of
the
war
Upon
learning
the
whereabouts
of
the
Prussian
army
the
French
swung
westwards
and
crossed
the
Saale
with
overwhelming
force
At
the
twin
battles
of
Jena
and
Auerstedt
fought
on
14
October
the
French
convincingly
defeated
the

and
inflicted

dead

over
the
Russians
at
the
Battle
of
Friedland
wiping
out
the

Russian
army
in

very
bloody
struggle
The
scale
of
their
defeat
convinced
the
Russians
to
make
peace
with
the
French
On
19
June
Czar
Alexander
sent
an
envoy
to
seek
an
armistice
with
Napoleon
The
latter
assured
the
envoy
that
the
Vistula
River
represented
the
natural
borders
between
French
and
Russian
influence
in
Europe
On
that
basis
the
two
emperors
began
peace
negotiations
at
the
town
of
Tilsit
after
meeting
on
an
iconic
raft
on

from

Duke
Constantine
to
make
peace
with

Given
the
victory
he
had

the

offered

that

withdraw
its
forces
from
Wallachia
and
Moldavia
and
hand
over
the
Ionian
Islands
to

his
young
brother
J
r
me

Prussia
s
humiliating
treatment
at
Tilsit
caused
a
deep
and
bitter
antagonism
which
festered
as
the
Napoleonic

progressed
Moreover
Alexander
s

led

Unhappy
with
this
change
of

by
the
Portuguese
government
Napoleon
negotiated
a
secret
treaty
with
Charles
IV
of
Spain
and
sent
an

to
invade
Portugal
132
On
17

French
troops
under
General
Junot
crossed
the
Pyrenees
with
Spanish
cooperation
and
headed

133
This
attack
was
the
first
step
in
what
would
eventually
become
the
Peninsular
War
a
six
year
struggle
that
significantly
sapped

Throughout

French

became

Napoleon
appointed
his
brother
Joseph
Bonaparte
as
the
new
King
of

in

summer

1808
The
appointment
enraged
a
heavily
religious
and
conservative
Spanish
population
Resistance
to
French
aggression
soon
spread
throughout
the
country
The
shocking
French
defeat
at

Before
going
to
Iberia
Napoleon
decided
to
address
several
lingering
issues
with
the
Russians
At
the
Congress
of
Erfurt
in
October
1808
Napoleon
hoped
to
keep
Russia
on
his
side
during
the
upcoming
struggle
in
Spain
and
during
any
potential
conflict
against
Austria
The
two
sides
reached
an
agreement
the
Erfurt
Convention
that
called
upon
Britain
to
cease
its
war
against
France
that
recognized
the
Russian
conquest
of
Finland
from
Sweden
and
that
affirmed
Russian
support
for
France
in
a
possible
war
against
Austria
to
the
best
of
its
ability
136
Napoleon
then
returned
to
France
and
prepared
for
war
The
Grande
Arm
e
under
the
Emperor
s
personal
command
rapidly
crossed
the
Ebro
River
in
November
1808
and
inflicted
a
series
of
crushing
defeats
against
the
Spanish
forces
After
clearing
the
last
Spanish
force
guarding
the
capital
at
Somosierra
Napoleon
entered
Madrid
on
4
December
with
80
000
troops
137
He
then
unleashed
his
soldiers
against
Moore
and
the
British
forces
The
British
were
swiftly
driven
to
the
coast
and
they
withdrew
from
Spain

after
a
last
stand

Napoleon
would
end
up
leaving
Iberia
in
order
to
deal
with
the
Austrians
in
Central
Europe
but
the
Peninsular
War
continued
on
long
after
his
absence
He
never
returned
to
Spain
after
the
1808
campaign
Several
months
after
Corunna
the
British
sent
another
army
to
the
peninsula
under
the
future
Duke
of
Wellington
The
war
then
settled
into
a
complex
and
asymmetric
strategic
deadlock
where
all
sides
struggled
to
gain
the
upper
hand
The
highlight
of
the
conflict
became
the
brutal
guerrilla
warfare
that
engulfed
much
of
the
Spanish
countryside
Both
sides
committed
the
worst
atrocities
of
the
Napoleonic
Wars
during
this
phase
of
the
conflict
The
vicious
guerrilla
fighting
in
Spain
largely
absent
from
the
French
campaigns
in
Central
Europe
severely
disrupted
the
French
lines
of
supply
and
communication
Although
France
maintained
roughly
300
000
troops
in
Iberia
during
the
Peninsular
War
the
vast
majority
were
tied
down
to
garrison
duty
and
to
intelligence
operations
138
The
French
were
never
able
to
concentrate
all
of
their
forces
effectively
prolonging
the
war
until
events
elsewhere
in
Europe
finally
turned
the
tide
in
favor
of
the
Allies
After
the
invasion
of
Russia
in
1812
the
number
of
French
troops
in
Spain
vastly
declined
as
Napoleon
needed
reinforcements
to
conserve
his
strategic
position
in
Europe
By
1814

In

to
find
the

Arm
e
in
a
dangerous
position
with
its
two
wings
separated
by
75
miles
121
km
and
joined
together
by
a
thin
cordon
of
Bavarian
troops
Charles
pressed
the
left
wing
of
the
French
army
and
hurled
his
men
towards
the
III
Corps
of
Marshal
Davout
In
response
Napoleon
came
up
with
a
plan
to
cut
off
the
Austrians
in
the
celebrated
Landshut
Maneuver
141
He
realigned
the
axis
of
his
army
and
marched
his
soldiers
towards
the
town
of
Eckm
hl
The
French
scored
a
convincing
win
in
the
resulting
Battle
of
Eckm
hl
forcing
Charles
to
withdraw
his
forces
over
the
Danube
and
into
Bohemia
On
13

Vienna
fell
for
the
second
time
in
four
years
although
the
war
continued
since
most
of
the
Austrian
army
had
survived
the
initial
engagements
in
Southern
Germany
By
17
May
the
main
Austrian
army
under
Charles
had
arrived
on
the
Marchfeld
Charles
kept
the
bulk
of
his
troops
several
miles
away
from
the
river
bank
in
hopes
of
concentrating
them
at
the
point
where
Napoleon
decided
to
cross
On
21
May
the
French
made
their
first
major
effort
to
cross
the
Danube
precipitating
the
Battle
of
Aspern
Essling
The
Austrians
enjoyed
a
comfortable
numerical
superiority
over
the
French
throughout
the
battle
on
the
first
day
Charles
disposed
of
110

soldiers
against

Napoleon
142
By
the
second
day
reinforcements
had
boosted
French
numbers
up
to
70

eventually
convinced

back
onto

Both
sides
inflicted
about

it
caused

because
it
proved
that

145
After
the
setback
at
Aspern
Essling
Napoleon
took
more
than
six
weeks
in
planning
and
preparing
for
contingencies
before
he
made
another
attempt
at
crossing
the
Danube
146
From
30
June
to
the
early
days
of
July
the
French
recrossed
the
Danube
in
strength
with
more
than
180

troops
marching
across
the
Marchfeld
towards
the
Austrians
146
Charles
received
the
French
with
150

of
his
own
men
147
In
the
ensuing
Battle
of
Wagram
which
also
lasted
two
days
Napoleon
commanded
his
forces
in
what
was
the
largest
battle
of
his
career

until
then
Napoleon
finished
off
the
battle
with
a
concentrated
central
thrust

punctured

this

Napoleon
s
farewell

Guard
20

1814
There
was
a
lull
in
fighting
over
the
winter
of
1812

while
both
the
Russians
and
the
French
rebuilt
their
forces
Napoleon
was
able
to
field
350
000
troops
163
Heartened
by
France
s
loss
in
Russia
Prussia
joined
with
Austria
Sweden
Russia
Great
Britain
Spain
and
Portugal
in
a
new
coalition
Napoleon
assumed
command
in
Germany
and
inflicted
a
series
of
defeats
on
the
Coalition
culminating
in
the
Battle
of
Dresden
in
August
1813
164
Despite
these
successes
the
numbers
continued
to
mount
against
Napoleon
and
the
French
army
was
pinned
down
by
a
force
twice
its
size
and
lost
at
the
Battle
of
Leipzig
This
was
by
far
the
largest
battle
of
the
Napoleonic
Wars
and
cost
more
than
90
000
casualties
in
total
165
The
Allies
offered
peace
terms
in
the
Frankfurt
proposals
in
November
1813
Napoleon
would
remain
as
Emperor
of
France
but
it
would
be
reduced
to
its
natural
frontiers
That
meant
that
France
could
retain
control
of
Belgium
Savoy
and
the
Rhineland
the
west
bank
of
the
Rhine
River
while
giving
up
control
of
all
the
rest
including
all
of
Spain
and
the
Netherlands
and
most
of
Italy
and
Germany
Metternich
told
Napoleon
these
were
the
best
terms
the
Allies
were
likely
to
offer
after
further
victories
the
terms
would
be
harsher
and
harsher
Metternich
s
motivation
was
to
maintain
France
as
a
balance
against
Russian
threats
while
ending
the
highly
destabilizing
series
of
wars
166
Napoleon
expecting
to
win
the
war
delayed
too
long
and
lost
this
opportunity
by
December
the
Allies
had
withdrawn
the
offer
When
his
back
was
to
the
wall
in
1814
he
tried
to
reopen
peace
negotiations
on
the
basis
of
accepting
the
Frankfurt
proposals
The
Allies
now
had
new
harsher
terms
that
included
the
retreat
of
France
to
its
1791
boundaries
which
meant
the
loss
of
Belgium
Napoleon
would
remain
Emperor
however
he
rejected
the
term
The
British
wanted
Napoleon
permanently
removed
they
prevailed
Napoleon
adamantly
refused
166
167
Napoleon
withdrew
back
into
France
his
army
reduced
to
70
000
soldiers
and
little
cavalry
he
faced
more
than
three
times

The
French
were
surrounded
British
armies
pressed
from
the
south
and

from
the
German
states
Napoleon
won
a
series
of
victories
in
the
Six
Days
Campaign
though
these
were
not
significant
enough
to
turn
the
tide

Napoleon
asserted
the

him
and
Ney
replied
the

would
follow
its
generals
While
the
ordinary
soldiers
and
regimental
officers
wanted
to
fight
on

any

any

Bowing
to

However
the

refused

from
Alexander
who
feared
that
Napoleon
might
find
an

Cause
of
death
The
cause
of
his
death
has
been
debated
Napoleon
s
physician
Fran
ois
Carlo
Antommarchi
led
the
autopsy
which
found
the
cause
of
death
to
be
stomach
cancer
Antommarchi
did
not
sign
the
official
report
192
Napoleon
s
father
had
died
of
stomach
cancer
although
this
was
seemingly
unknown
at
the
time
of
the
autopsy
193
Antommarchi
found
evidence
of
a
stomach
ulcer
this
was
the
most
convenient
explanation
for
the
British
who
wanted
to
avoid
criticism
over
their
care
of
Napoleon

Napoleon
on
His
Death
Bed
by
Horace
Vernet
1826
In
1955
the
diaries
of
Napoleon
s
valet
Louis
Marchand
were
published
His
description
of
Napoleon
in
the
months
before
his
death
led
Sten
Forshufvud
in
a
1961
paper
in
Nature
to
put
forward
other
causes
for
his
death
including
deliberate
arsenic
poisoning
194
Arsenic
was
used
as
a
poison
during
the
era
because
it
was
undetectable
when
administered
over
a
long
period
Forshufvud
in
a
1978
book
with
Ben
Weider
noted
that
Napoleon
s
body
was
found
to
be
well
preserved
when
moved
in
1840
Arsenic
is
a
strong
preservative
and
therefore
this
supported
the
poisoning
hypothesis
Forshufvud
and
Weider
observed
that
Napoleon
had
attempted
to
quench
abnormal
thirst
by
drinking
large
amounts
of
orgeat
syrup
that
contained
cyanide
compounds
in
the
almonds
used
for
flavouring
194
They
maintained
that
the
potassium
tartrate
used
in
his
treatment
prevented
his
stomach
from
expelling
these
compounds
and
that
his
thirst
was
a
symptom
of
the
poison
Their
hypothesis
was
that
the
calomel
given
to
Napoleon
became
an
overdose
which
killed
him
and
left
extensive
tissue
damage
behind
194
According
to
a
2007
article
the
type
of
arsenic
found
in
Napoleon
s
hair
shafts
was
mineral
the
most
toxic
and
according
to
toxicologist
Patrick
Kintz
this
supported
the
conclusion
that
he
was
murdered
195
There
have
been
modern
studies
that
have
supported
the
original
autopsy
finding
195
In
a
2008
study
researchers
analysed
samples
of
Napoleon
s
hair
from
throughout
his
life
as
well
as
samples
from
his
family
and
other
contemporaries
All
samples
had
high
levels
of
arsenic
approximately
100
times
higher
than
the
current
average
According
to
these
researchers
Napoleon
s
body
was
already
heavily
contaminated
with
arsenic
as
a
boy
and
the
high
arsenic
concentration
in
his
hair
was
not
caused
by
intentional
poisoning
people
were
constantly
exposed
to
arsenic
from
glues
and
dyes
throughout
their
lives
note
7
Studies
published
in
2007
and
2008
dismissed
evidence
of
arsenic
poisoning
and
confirmed
evidence
of
peptic
ulcer
and
gastric
cancer
as
the
cause
of
death

As
an

Napoleon
was
a
deist
Napoleon
s

was

absent

distant
God
However
he
had
a
keen
appreciation
of
the
power
of
organized
religion
in
social
and
political
affairs
and
paid
a
great

bending

Leaders
of
the
Catholic
Church
taking
the
civil
oath
required
by
the
Concordat
Seeking
national
reconciliation
between
revolutionaries
and
Catholics
the
Concordat
of
1801
was
signed
on
15
July
1801
between
Napoleon
and
Pope
Pius
VII
It
solidified
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
as
the
majority
church
of
France
and
brought
back
most
of
its
civil
status
The
hostility
of
devout
Catholics
against
the
state
had
now
largely
been
resolved
It
did
not
restore
the
vast
church
lands
and
endowments
that
had
been
seized
during
the
revolution
and
sold
off
As
a
part
of
the
Concordat
he
presented
another
set
of
laws
called
the
Organic
Articles
199

While
the
Concordat
restored
much
power
to
the
papacy
the
balance
of
church
state
relations
had
tilted
firmly
in
Napoleon
s
favour
He
selected
the
bishops
and
supervised
church
finances
Napoleon
and
the
pope
both
found
the
Concordat
useful
Similar
arrangements
were
made
with
the
Church
in
territories
controlled
by
Napoleon
especially
Italy
and
Germany
201
Now
Napoleon
could
win
favor
with
the
Catholics
while
also
controlling
Rome
in
a
political
sense
Napoleon
said
in
April
1801
Skillful
conquerors
have
not
got
entangled
with
priests
They
can
both
contain
them
and
use
them
French
children
were
issued

catechism
that

to

Religious
emancipation
Further
information
Napoleon
and
the
Jews
and
Napoleon
and
Protestants
Napoleon
emancipated
Jews
as
well
as
Protestants
in
Catholic
countries
and
Catholics
in
Protestant
countries
from
laws
which
restricted
them
to
ghettos
and
he
expanded
their
rights
to
property
worship
and
careers
Despite
the
anti
semitic
reaction
to
Napoleon
s
policies
from
foreign
governments
and
within
France
he
believed
emancipation
would
benefit
France
by
attracting
Jews
to
the
country
given
the
restrictions
they
faced
elsewhere
203
He
stated
I
will
never
accept
any
proposals
that
will
obligate
the
Jewish
people
to
leave
France
because
to
me
the
Jews
are
the
same
as
any
other
citizen
in
our
country
It
takes
weakness
to
chase
them
out
of
the
country
but
it
takes
strength
to
assimilate
them
204
He
was
seen
as
so
favourable
to
the
Jews
that
the
Russian
Orthodox
Church
formally
condemned
him
as
Antichrist
and
the
Enemy
of
God

209
He
understood
military
technology
but
was
not
an
innovator
in
that
regard
210
He
was
an
innovator
in
using
the
financial
bureaucratic
and
diplomatic
resources
of
France
He
could
rapidly
dictate
a
series
of
complex
commands
to
his
subordinates
keeping
in
mind
where
major
units
were
expected
to
be
at
each
future
point
and
like
a
chess
master
seeing
the
best

moves
ahead
211
Napoleon
s
divisional
commanders
were
immediately
impressed
by
his
capacity
for
hard
work
from
the
beginning
of
Italy
campaign
Subordinates
could
never
say
they
wouldattend
to
something
and
then
let
it
slide
and
the
staff
who
had
been
stationary
in
Nice
for
four
years
suddenly
felt
pulsating
effect
of
Napoleon
s
energy
In
the
nine
month
between
arrival
in
Nice
and
the
end
of
1776
he
sent
more
than
eight
hundred
letters
and
despatches
covering
everything
from
where
drummer
boys
should
stand
in
parades
to
the
conditions
under
which
the
Marseillaise
should
be
playedAugereu
was
first
of
his
generals
to
be
won
over
followed
Massena
That
little
bastard
of
a
general
actually
frightened
me
Augereau
would
later
tell
Massena
212
Napoleon
maintained
strict
efficient
work
habits
prioritizing
what
needed
to
be
done
He
cheated
at
cards
but
repaid
the
losses
he
had
to
win
at
everything
he
attempted
213
He
kept
relays
of
staff
and
secretaries
at
work
Unlike
many
generals
Napoleon
did
not
examine
history
to
ask
what
Hannibal
or
Alexander
or
anyone
else
did
in
a
similar
situation
Critics
said
he
won
many
battles
simply
because
of
luck
Napoleon
responded
Give
me
lucky
generals
aware
that
luck
comes
to
leaders
who
recognize
opportunity
and
seize
it
214
Dwyer
states
that
Napoleon
s
victories
at
Austerlitz
and
Jena
in
1805
06
heightened
his
sense
of
self
grandiosity
leaving
him
even
more
certain
of
his
destiny
and
invincibility
215
In
terms
of
influence
on
events
it
was
more
than
Napoleon
s
personality
that
took
effect
He
reorganized
France
itself
to
supply
the
men
and
money
needed
for
wars
216
He
inspired
his
men
Wellington
said
his
presence
on
the
battlefield
was
worth
40
000
soldiers
for
he
inspired
confidence
from
privates
to
field
marshals
217
He
also
unnerved
the
enemy
At
the
Battle
of
Auerstadt
in
1806
King
Frederick
William
III
of
Prussia
outnumbered
the
French
by
63
000
to
27
000
however
when
he
was
told
mistakenly
that
Napoleon
was
in
command
he
ordered
a
hasty
retreat
that
turned
into
a
rout
218
The
force
of
his
personality
neutralized
material
difficulties
as
his
soldiers
fought
with
the
confidence
that
with
Napoleon
in
charge
they
would
surely
win

Guard
the
regiment
that
often
served
as
his
personal

Napoleon
has
become
a
worldwide
cultural
icon
who
symbolises
military
genius
and
political
power
Martin
van
Creveld
described
him
as
the
most
competent
human
being
who
ever
lived
220
Since
his
death
many
towns
streets
ships
and
even
cartoon
characters
have
been
named
after
him
He
has
been
portrayed
in
hundreds
of
films
and
discussed
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
books
and
articles
221
During
the
Napoleonic
Wars
he
was
taken
seriously
by
the
British
press
as
a
dangerous
tyrant
poised
to
invade
The
British
nicknamed
him
Little
Boney
in
a
strong
fit
222
A
nursery
rhyme
warned
children
that
Bonaparte
ravenously
ate
naughty
people
the
bogeyman
223
He
seemed
to
be
of
an
average
height
for
his
time
5
feet
7
inches
1
70
m
but
beginning
in
1803
with
a
caricature
from
James
Gillray
he
was
mocked
in
British
newspapers
as
a
short
tempered
small
man
222
Some
historians
believe
that
the
reason
of
the
mistake
about
his
size
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
obsolete
French
feet
were
used
but
he
had
done
his
best
to
make
French
convert
to
the
metric
system
which
was
adopted
already
in
1793
208
Napoleon
surrounded
himself
with
tall
bodyguards
and
was
affectionately
nicknamed
le
petit
caporal
reflecting
his
reported
camaraderie
with
his
soldiers
rather
than
his
height
In
spite
of
that
the
Napoleon
Complex
is
named
after
him
to
describe
men
who
have
an
inferiority
complex
and
become
aggressive
due
to
short
stature
In
1908
Alfred
Adler
a
psychologist
cited
Napoleon
to
describe
an
inferiority
complex
in
which
short
people
adopt
an
over
aggressive
behaviour
to
compensate
for
lack
of
height
this
inspired
the
term
Napoleon
complex
224
The
stock
character
of
Napoleon
is
a
comically
short
petty
tyrant
and
this
has
become
a
clich
in
popular
culture
He
is
often
portrayed
wearing
a
large
bicorne
hat
with
a
hand
in
waistcoat
gesture
a
reference
to
the
painting
produced
in
1812
by
Jacques
Louis
David
225
When
he
became
First
Consul
and
later
Emperor
Napoleon
eschewed
his
general
s
uniform
and
habitually
wore
the
green
colonel
uniform
non
Hussar
of
a
colonel
of
the
Chasseur
Cheval
of
the
Imperial
Guard
the
regiment
that
served
as
his
personal
escort
many
times
with
a
large
bicorne
He
also
habitually
wore
usually
on
Sundays
the
blue
uniform
of
a
colonel

the
Imperial

and
the
Order
of
the
Iron
Crown
decorations
white
French

which
sought
to
reconcile
the
mostly
Catholic
population
to
his
regime
It

of
the
1804
original
edition
of
the
Code
Civil
Napoleon
s
set
of
civil
laws
the
Code
Civil
now
often
known
as
the
Napoleonic
Code
was
prepared
by
committees
of
legal
experts
under
the
supervision
of
Jean
Jacques
R
gis

Cambac
r
s
the
Second
Consul
Napoleon
participated
actively
in
the
sessions
of
the
Council
of
State
that
revised
the
drafts
The
development
of
the
code
was
a
fundamental
change
in
the
nature
of
the
civil
law
legal
system
with
its
stress
on
clearly
written
and
accessible
law
Other
codes
Les

codes
were
commissioned
by
Napoleon
to
codify
criminal
and
commerce
law
a
Code
of
Criminal
Instruction
was
published
which
enacted
rules
of
due
process
228
The
Napoleonic
code
was
adopted
throughout
much
of
Continental
Europe
though
only
in
the
lands
he
conquered
and
remained
in
force
after
Napoleon
s
defeat
Napoleon
said
My
true
glory
is
not
to
have
won
forty
battles
Waterloo
will
erase
the
memory
of
so
many
victories
But
what
will
live
forever
is

The

influences
a
quarter
of
the
world
s
jurisdictions
such
as
that
of
in
Continental
Europe
the
Americas
and
Africa
230
Dieter
Langewiesche
described
the
code
as
a
revolutionary
project
which
spurred
the
development
of
bourgeois
society
in
Germany
by
the
extension
of
the
right
to
own
property
and
an
acceleration
towards
the
end
of
feudalism
Napoleon
reorganised
what
had
been
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
made
up
of
more
than
a
thousand
entities
quantify
into
a
more
streamlined
forty
state
Confederation
of
the
Rhine
this
provided
the
basis
for
the
German
Confederation
and
the
unification
of
Germany
in
1871
231
The
movement
toward
national
unification
in
Italy
was
similarly
precipitated
by
Napoleonic
rule
232
These
changes
contributed
to
the
development
of
nationalism
and
the
nation
state
233
Napoleon
implemented
a
wide
array
of
liberal
reforms
in
France
and
across
Continental
Europe
especially
in
Italy
and
Germany
as
summarized
by
British
historian
Andrew
Roberts
The
ideas
that
underpin
our
modern
world
meritocracy
equality
before
the
law
property
rights
religious
toleration
modern
secular
education
sound
finances
and
so
on
were
championed
consolidated
codified
and
geographically
extended
by
Napoleon
To
them
he
added
a
rational
and
efficient
local
administration
an
end
to
rural
banditry
the
encouragement
of
science
and
the
arts
the
abolition
of
feudalism
and
the
greatest
codification
of
laws
since
the
fall
of
the
Roman
Empire
234
Napoleon
directly
overthrew
feudal
remains
in
much
of
western
Continental
Europe
He
liberalised
property
laws
ended
seigneurial
dues
abolished
the
guild
of
merchants
and
craftsmen
to
facilitate
entrepreneurship
legalised
divorce
closed
the
Jewish
ghettos
and
made
Jews
equal
to
everyone
else
The
Inquisition
ended
as
did
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
The
power
of
church
courts
and
religious
authority
was
sharply
reduced
and
equality
under
the
law
was
proclaimed
for
all
men

I
strengthened

s

to

In
the
field
of
military
organisation
Napoleon
borrowed
from
previous
theorists
such
as
Jacques
Antoine
Hippolyte
Comte
de
Guibert
and
from
the
reforms
of
preceding
French
governments
and
then
developed
much
of
what
was
already
in
place
He
continued
the
policy
which
emerged
from
the
Revolution
of
promotion
based
primarily
on
merit
236
Corps
replaced
divisions
as
the
largest
army
units
mobile
artillery
was
integrated
into
reserve
batteries
the
staff
system
became
more
fluid
and
cavalry
returned
as
an
important
formation
in
French
military
doctrine
These
methods
are
now
referred
to
as
essential
features
of
Napoleonic
warfare
236
Though
he
consolidated
the
practice
of
modern
conscription
introduced
by
the
Directory
one
of
the
restored
monarchy
s
first
acts
was
to
end
it
237
His
opponents
learned
from
Napoleon
s
innovations
The
increased
importance
of
artillery
after
1807
stemmed
from
his
creation
of
a
highly
mobile
artillery
force
the
growth
in
artillery
numbers
and
changes
in
artillery
practices
As
a
result
of
these
factors
Napoleon
rather
than
relying
on
infantry
to
wear
away
the
enemy
s
defenses
now
could
use
massed
artillery
as
a
spearhead
to
pound
a
break
in
the
enemy
s
line
that
was
then
exploited
by
supporting
infantry
and
cavalry
McConachy
rejects
the
alternative
theory
that
growing
reliance
on
artillery
by
the
French
army
beginning
in
1807
was
an
outgrowth
of
the
declining
quality
of
the
French
infantry
and
later
France
s
inferiority
in
cavalry
numbers
238
Weapons
and
other
kinds
of
military
technology
remained
static
through

change
239
Napoleon
s
biggest
influence
was
in
the

of
warfare
Antoine
Henri
Jomini
explained
Napoleon
s
methods
in
a
widely
used
textbook
that
influenced
all
European
and
American
armies
240
Napoleon
was
regarded
by
the
influential
military
theorist
Carl
von
Clausewitz
as
a
genius
in
the
operational
art
of
war
and

rank
him
as

military
commander

242
Under
Napoleon
a
new
emphasis
towards
the
destruction
not
just
outmanoeuvring
of
enemy
armies
emerged
Invasions
of
enemy

occurred
over

decisive
The

the
French
sphere
of
influence
Napoleon
took
a
retrograde
step
in
1812
when
he
passed
legislation
to
introduce
the
mesures
usuelles
traditional
units
of
measurement
for
retail
trade
244
a
system
of
measure
that
resembled
the
pre
revolutionary
units
but
were
based
on
the
kilogram
and
the
metre
for
example
the
livre
metrique
metric
pound
was
500
g
245
instead
of
489
5
g
the
value
of
the
livre
du
roi
the
king
s
pound
246
Other
units
of
measure
were
rounded
in
a
similar
manner
prior
to
the
definitive
introduction
of
the
metric
system
across
parts
of
Europe
in
the
middle
of
the
19th
century
247
Education
Napoleon
s
educational
reforms
laid
the
foundation
of
a
modern
system
of
education
in
France
and
throughout
much
of
Europe
248
Napoleon
synthesized
the
best
academic
elements
from
the
Ancien
R
gime
The
Enlightenment
and
the
Revolution
with
the
aim
of
establishing
a
stable
well
educated
and
prosperous
society
He
made
French
the
only
official
language
He
left
some
primary
education
in
the
hands
of
religious
orders
but
he
offered
public
support
to
secondary
education
Napoleon
founded
a
number
of
state
secondary
schools
lyc
es
designed
to
produce
a
standardized
education
that
was
uniform
across
France
All
students
were
taught
the
sciences
along
with
modern
and
classical
languages
Unlike
the
system
during
the
Ancien
R
gime
religious
topics
did
not
dominate
the
curriculum
although
they
were
present
with
the
teachers
from
the
clergy
Napoleon
hoped
to
use
religion
to
produce
social
stability
249
He
gave
special
attention
to
the
advanced
centers
such
as
the
cole
Polytechnique
that
provided
both
military
expertise
and
state
of
the
art
research
in
science
250
Napoleon
made
some
of
the
first
efforts
at
establishing
a
system
of
secular
and
public
education
when
The
system
featured
scholarships
and
strict
discipline
with
the
result
being
a
French
educational
system
that
outperformed
its
European
counterparts
many
of
which
borrowed
from
the
French
system

Memory
and
evaluation
Criticism
The
Third
of
May
1808
by
Francisco
Goya
showing
Spanish
resisters
being
executed
by
Napoleon
s
troops
In
the
political
realm
historians
debate
whether
Napoleon
was
an
enlightened
despot
who
laid
the
foundations
of
modern
Europe
or
instead
a
megalomaniac
who
wrought
greater
misery
than
any
man
before
the
coming
of
Hitler
252
Many
historians
have
concluded
that
he
had
grandiose
foreign
policy
ambitions
The
Continental
powers
as
late
as
1808
were
willing
to
give
him
nearly
all
of
his
gains
and
titles
but
some
scholars
maintain
he
was
overly
aggressive
and
pushed
for
too
much
until
his
empire
collapsed
253
254
Napoleon
ended
lawlessness
and
disorder
in
post
Revolutionary
France
255
He
was
considered
a
tyrant
and
usurper
by
his
opponents
256
His
critics
who
charge
that
he
was
not
troubled
when
faced
with
the
prospect
of
war
and
death
for
thousands
turned
his
search
for
undisputed
rule
into
a
series
of
conflicts
throughout
Europe
and
ignored
treaties
and
conventions
alike
His
role
in
the
Haitian
Revolution
and
decision
to
reinstate
slavery
in
France
s
overseas
colonies
are
controversial
and
affect
his
reputation
257
Napoleon
institutionalised
plunder
of
conquered
territories
French
museums
contain
art
stolen
by
Napoleon
s
forces
from
across
Europe
Artefacts
were
brought
to
the
Mus
e
du
Louvre
for
a
grand
central
museum
his
example
would
later
serve
as
inspiration
for
more
notorious
imitators
258
He
was
compared
to
Adolf
Hitler
most
famously
by
the
historian
Pieter
Geyl
in
1947
259
and
Claude
Ribbe
in
2005
260
David
G
Chandler
a
foremost
historian
of
Napoleonic
warfare
wrote
in
1973
that
Nothing
could
be
more
degrading
to
the
former
Napoleon
and
more
flattering
to
the
latter
Hitler
The
comparison
is
odious
On
the
whole
Napoleon
was
inspired
by
a
noble
dream
wholly
dissimilar
from
Hitler
s
Napoleon
left
great
and
lasting
testimonies
to
his
genius
in
codes
of
law
and
national
identities
which
survive
to
the
present
day
Adolf
Hitler
left
nothing
but
destruction
261
Critics
argue
Napoleon
s
true
legacy
must
reflect
the
loss
of
status
for
France
and
needless
deaths
brought
by
his
rule
historian
Victor
Davis
Hanson
writes
After
all
the
military
record
is
unquestioned
17
years
of
wars
perhaps
six
million
Europeans
dead
France
bankrupt
her
overseas
colonies
lost
262
McLynn
states
that
He
can
be
viewed
as
the
man
who
set
back
European
economic
life
for
a
generation
by
the
dislocating
impact
of
his
wars
256
Vincent
Cronin
replies
that
such
criticism
relies
on
the
flawed
premise
that
Napoleon
was
responsible
for
the
wars
which
bear
his
name
when
in
fact
France
was
the
victim
of
a
series
of
coalitions
which
aimed
to
destroy
the
ideals
of
the
Revolution

Napoleon
s
use
of
propaganda
contributed
to
his
rise
to
power
legitimated
his
r
gime
and
established
his
image
for
posterity
Strict
censorship
controlling

was
part
of
his
propaganda
scheme
aimed
at
portraying
him
as
bringing

stability
to
France
The
propagandistic
rhetoric
changed
in

events
and
to
the
atmosphere
of
Napoleon
s
reign
focusing
first
on
his
role
as
a
general
in

and
identification
as
a
soldier
and
moving
to
his
role
as
emperor
and
a
civil
leader
Specifically
targeting
his
civilian
audience
Napoleon
fostered
a
relationship
with
the
contemporary
art
community
taking
an
active

in
commissioning
and

in

House

Napoleon
was
responsible
for
spreading
the
values
of
the
French
Revolution
to
other
countries
especially
in
legal
reform
and
the
abolition
of
serfdom
269
After
the
fall
of
Napoleon
not
only
was
the
Napoleonic
Code
retained
by
conquered
countries
including
the
Netherlands
Belgium
parts
of
Italy
and
Germany
but
has
been
used
as
the
basis
of
certain
parts
of
law
outside
Europe
including
the
Dominican
Republic
the
US
state
of
Louisiana
and
the
Canadian

270
The

of
Napoleon
in

is
favorable
for
his
support
for
independence
and

to

his
legal
code
the

and
the

271
Napoleon
could
be
considered
one
of
the
founders
of
modern
Germany
After
dissolving
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
he
reduced
the
number
of
German
states
from
300
to
less
than
50
prior
to
the
German
Unification
A
byproduct
of
the
French
occupation
was
a
strong
development
in
German
nationalism
Napoleon
also
significantly
aided
the
United
States
when
he
agreed
to
sell
the
territory
of
Louisiana
for
15
million
dollars
during
the
presidency
of
Thomas
Jefferson
That
territory
almost
doubled
the
size
of
the

adding
the
equivalent
of
13
states
to

when
he
was
26
she
was
a
32
year
old
widow
whose
first
husband
had
been
executed
during
the
Revolution
Until
she
met
Bonaparte
she
had
been
known
as
Rose
a
name
which
he
disliked
He
called
her
Jos
phine
instead
and
she
went
by
this
name
henceforth
Bonaparte
often
sent
her
love
letters
while
on
his
campaigns
273
He
formally
adopted
her
son
Eug
ne
and
cousin
St
phanie

arranged
dynastic
marriages
for
them
Jos
phine
had
her
daughter
Hortense
marry

brother
Louis
274
Jos
phine
had
lovers
such
as
lieutenant
Hippolyte

during

campaign
275
Napoleon
learnt
of
that
affair
and
a
letter
he
wrote
about
it
was
intercepted
by
the
British
and
published
widely
to
embarrass

While
Napoleon
s
mistresses
had
children
by
him
Jos
phine
did
not
produce
an
heir
possibly
because
of
either
the
stresses
of
her
imprisonment
during
the
Reign
of
Terror
or
an
abortion
she
may
have
had
in
her
twenties
278
Napoleon
chose
divorce
so
he
could
remarry
in
search
of
an
heir
Despite
his
divorce
from
Josephine
Napoleon
showed
his
dedication
to
her
for
the
rest
of
his
life
When
he
heard
the
news
of
her
death
while
on
exile
in
Elba
he
locked
himself
in
his
room
and
would
not
come
out
for
two
full
days
176
Her
name
would
also
be
his
final
word
on
his
deathbed
in
1821
In
March
1810
he
married
the
19
year
old
Marie
Louise
Archduchess
of
Austria
and
a
great
niece
of
Marie
Antoinette
by
proxy
thus
he
had
married
into
a
German
royal
and
imperial
family
279
Louise
was
less
than
happy
with
the
arrangement
at
least
at
first
stating
Just
to
see
the
man
would
be
the
worst
form
of
torture
Her
great
aunt
had
been
executed
in
France
while
Napoleon
had
fought
numerous
campaigns
against
Austria
all
throughout
his
military
career
However
she
seemed
to
warm
up
to
him
over
time
After
her
wedding
she
wrote
to
her
father
He
loves
me
very
much
I
respond

sincerely
There
is
something
very
fetching
and
very
eager
about
him
that
is
impossible
to
resist
176
Napoleon
and
Marie
Louise
remained
married
until
his
death
though
she
did
not
join
him

Extent
of
the
Teutonic
Order
in
1300
Formed
in
the
year
1190
5
in
Acre
in
the
Levant
the
medieval
Order
played
an
important
role
in
Outremer
controlling
the
port
tolls
of
Acre
After
Christian
forces
were
defeated
in
the
Middle
East
the
Order
moved
to
Transylvania
in
1211
to
help
defend
the
South
Eastern
borders
of
the
Kingdom
of
Hungary
against
the
Kipchaks
The
Knights
were
expelled
by
force
of
arms
by
King
Andrew
II
of
Hungary
in
1225
after
attempting
to
place
themselves
under
papal
instead
of
the
original
Hungarian
sovereignty
and
thus
to
become
independent
6
In
1230
following
the
Golden
Bull
of
Rimini
Grand
Master
Hermann
von
Salza
and
Duke
Konrad
I
of
Masovia
launched
the
Prussian
Crusade
a
joint
invasion
of
Prussia
intended
to
Christianize
the
Baltic
Old
Prussians
The
Knights
had
quickly
taken
steps
against
their
Polish
hosts
and
with
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
s
support
had
changed
the
status
of
Che
mno
Land
also
Ziemia
Chelminska
or
Kulmerland
where
they
were
invited
by
the
Polish
prince
into
their
own
property
Starting
from
there
the
Order
created
the
independent
Monastic
State
of
the
Teutonic
Knights
adding
continuously
the
conquered
Prussians
territory
and
subsequently
conquered
Livonia
Over
time
the
kings
of
Poland
denounced
the
Order
for
expropriating
their
lands
specifically
Che
mno
Land
and
later
the
Polish
lands
of
Pomerelia
also
Pomorze
Gda
skie
or
Pomerania
Kujawy
and
Dobrzy
Land
The
Order
theoretically
lost
its
main
purpose
in
Europe
with
the
Christianization
of
Lithuania
However
it
initiated
numerous
campaigns
against
its
Christian
neighbours
the
Kingdom
of
Poland
the
Grand
Duchy
of
Lithuania
and
the
Novgorod
Republic
after
assimilating
the
Livonian
Order
The
Teutonic
Knights
had
a
strong
economic
base
which
enabled
them
to
hire
mercenaries
from
throughout
Europe
to
augment
their
feudal
levies
and
they
also
became
a
naval
power
in
the
Baltic
Sea
In
1410
a
Polish
Lithuanian
army
decisively
defeated
the
Order
and
broke
its
military
power
at
the
Battle
of
Grunwald
Tannenberg
However
the
capital
of
the
Teutonic
Knights
was
successfully
defended
in
the
following
Siege
of
Marienburg
and
the
Order
was
saved
from
collapse
In
1515
Holy
Roman
Emperor
Maximilian
I
made
a
marriage
alliance
with
Sigismund
I
of
Poland
Lithuania
Thereafter
the
empire
did
not
support
the
Order
against
Poland
In
1525
Grand
Master
Albert
of
Brandenburg
resigned
and
converted
to
Lutheranism
becoming
Duke
of
Prussia
as
a
vassal
of
Poland
Soon
after
the
Order
lost
Livonia
and
its
holdings
in
the
Protestant
areas
of
Germany
7
The
Order
did
keep
its
considerable
holdings
in
Catholic
areas
of
Germany
until
1809
when
Napoleon
Bonaparte
ordered
its
dissolution
and
the
Order
lost
its
last
secular
holdings
However
the
Order
continued
to
exist
as
a
charitable
and
ceremonial
body
It
was
outlawed
by
Adolf
Hitler
in
1938
8
but
re
established
in
1945
9
Today
it
operates
primarily
with
charitable
aims
in
Central
Europe
The
Knights
wore
white
surcoats
with
a
black
cross
A
cross
patt
e
was
sometimes
used
as
their
coat
of
arms
this
image
was
later
used
for
military
decoration
and
insignia
by
the
Kingdom
of
Prussia
and
Germany
as
the
Iron
Cross
and
Pour

The

of
the

was

In
1143
Pope
Celestine
II
ordered
the
Knights
Hospitaller
to
take
over
management
of
a
German
hospital
in
Jerusalem
which
according
to
the
chronicler
Jean
d
Ypres
accommodated
the
countless
German
pilgrims
and
crusaders
who
could
neither
speak
the
local
language
nor
Latin
patri
linguam
ignorantibus
atque
Latinam
11
Although
formally
an
institution
of
the
Hospitallers
the
pope
commanded
that
the
prior
and
the
brothers
of
the
domus
Theutonicorum
house
of
the
Germans
should
always
be
Germans
themselves
so
a
tradition
of
a
German
led
religious
institution
could
develop
during
the
12th
century
in
the
Kingdom
of
Jerusalem
12
Hermann
von
Salza
served
as
the
fourth
Grand
Master
of
the
Teutonic
Knights
1209
to
1239
After
the
loss
of
Jerusalem
in
1187
some
merchants
from
L
beck
and
Bremen
took
up
the
idea
and
founded
a
field
hospital
for
the
duration
of
the
Siege
of
Acre
in
1190
which
became
the
nucleus
of
the
order
Celestine
III
recognized
it
in
1192
by
granting
the
monks
Augustinian
Rule
However
based
on
the
model
of
the
Knights
Templar
it
was
transformed
into
a
military
order
in
1198
and
the
head
of
the
order
became
known
as
the
Grand
Master
magister
hospitalis
It
received
papal
orders
for
crusades
to
take
and
hold
Jerusalem
for
Christianity
and
defend
the
Holy
Land
against
the
Muslim
Saracens
During
the
rule
of
Grand
Master
Hermann
von
Salza
1209
1239
the
Order
changed
from
being
a
hospice
brotherhood
for
pilgrims
to
primarily
a
military
order
The
Order
was
founded
in
Acre
and
the
Knights
purchased
Montfort
Starkenberg
northeast
of
Acre
in
1220
This
castle
which
defended
the
route
between
Jerusalem
and
the
Mediterranean
Sea
was
made
the
seat
of
the
Grand
Masters
in
1229
although
they
returned
to
Acre
after
losing
Montfort
to
Muslim
control
in
1271
The
Order
also
had
a
castle
at
Amouda
in
Armenia
Minor
The
Order
received
donations
of
land
in
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
especially
in

Germany
and
Italy
Frankish
Greece
and
the

Order
ruled
Prussia
under
charters
issued
by
the

and
the
Holy

Emperor
as
a
sovereign
monastic
state
comparable
to
the
arrangement
of
the
Knights
Hospitallers
in
Rhodes
and
later
in
Malta
To
make
up
for
losses
from
the
plague
and
to
replace
the
partially
exterminated
native
population
the
Order
encouraged
immigration
from
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
mostly
Germans
Flemish
and
Dutch
and
from
Masovia
Poles
the
later
Masurians
These
included
nobles
burghers
and
peasants
and
the
surviving
Old
Prussians
were
gradually
assimilated
through
Germanization
The
settlers
founded
numerous
towns
and
cities
on
former
Prussian
settlements
The
Order
itself
built
a
number
of
castles

from

Against
Lithuania
edit
The
Teutonic
Knights
began
to
direct
their
campaigns
against
pagan
Lithuania
see
Lithuanian
mythology
due
to
the
aim
to
have
all
the
world
be
Christian
especially
after
the
fall
of
the
Kingdom
of
Jerusalem
at
Acre
in
1291
The
knights
moved
their
headquarters
to
Venice
from
which
they
planned
the
recovery
of
Outremer
23
Because
Lithuania
Propria
remained
non
Christian
until
the
end
of
the
14th
century
much
later
than
the
rest
of
eastern
Europe
many
knights
from
western
European
countries
such
as
England
and
France
journeyed
to
Prussia
to
participate
in
the
seasonal
campaigns
reyse
against
the
Grand
Duchy
of
Lithuania
Some
of
them
campaigned
against
pagans
to
obtain
remission
for
their
sins
while
others
fought
to
gain
military
experience
In
1348
the
Order
won
a
great
victory
over
the
Lithuanians
in
the
Battle
of
Str

severely
weakening
them
The
Teutonic
Knights
won
a
decisive
victory
over
Lithuania
in
the
Battle
of
Rudau
in
1370
Warfare
between
the
Order
and
the
Lithuanians
was
especially
brutal
Non
Christians
were
seen
as
lacking
rights
possessed
by
Christians
Because
enslavement
of
non
Christians
was
seen
as
acceptable
at
the
time
and
the
subdued
native
Prussians
demanded
land
or
payment
the
Knights
often
used
captured
pagan
Lithuanians
for
forced
labor
The
contemporary
Austrian
poet
Peter
Suchenwirt
described
treatment
he
witnessed
of
pagans
by
the
Knights
Women
and
children
were
taken
captive
What
a
jolly
medley
could
be
seen
Many
a
woman
could
be
seen
Two
children
tied
to
her
body
One
behind
and
one
in
front
On
a
horse
without
spurs
Barefoot
had
they
ridden
here
The
heathens
were
made
to
suffer
Many
were
captured
and
in
every
case
Were
their
hands
tied
together
They
were
led
off
all
tied
up
Just
like
hunting
dogs
24
It
was
a
total
war
in
every
sense
of
the
word
lasting
over
200
years
with
its
front
line
along
both
banks
of
the
Neman
River
with
as
many
as
twenty
forts
and
castles
between
Sered
ius
and
Jurbarkas
alone
creating
an
absolutely
desolated
wasteland
This
struggle
was
so
deeply
etched
into
Lithuanian
culture
and
mentality
that
even
now
it
is
a
prominent
source
of
national

A
dispute
over

succession
to
the
Duchy
of
Pomerelia
embroiled
the
Order
in
further
conflict
at
the
beginning
of
the
14th
century
The
Margraves
of
Brandenburg
had
claims
to
the
duchy
that
they
acted
upon
after

death
of
King
Wenceslaus
of

was
opposed

from

which
subsequently
occupied
all
of

the

then
led
by

The
Order
under

from
Danzig
in

then
refused

the

The

of
the
Teutonic
Knights
The
persecution
and
abolition
of
the
powerful
Knights
Templar
which
began
in
1307
worried
the
Teutonic
Knights
but
control
of

allowed
them
to

the

reached
the

of
its

and
hosted
numerous
European
crusaders

King
Albert
of

ceded
Gotland
to

understanding
that
they

conquered

Queen
Jadwiga

taking
the
name
W

Jagie

becoming
King
of
Poland
This
created
a
personal
union
between
the
two
countries
and
a
potentially
formidable
opponent
for
the
Teutonic
Knights
The
Order
initially
managed
to
play
Jagiello
and
his
cousin
Vytautas
against
each
other
but
this
strategy
failed
when
Vytautas
began
to
suspect
that
the
Order
was
planning
to
annex
parts
of
his
territory
The
baptism
of
Jagiello
began
the
official
conversion
of
Lithuania
to
Christianity
Although
the
crusading

ended
when
Prussia

the

The
Polish
Lithuanian
army
then
began
the
Siege
of
Marienburg
the
capital
of
the
Order
but
was
unable
to
take
Marienburg
owing
to
the
resistance
of
Heinrich
von

When
the
First
Peace

Thorn
was
signed
in
1411
the
Order
managed
to
retain
essentially
all
of
its
territories
although
the
Knights
reputation
as
invincible
warriors
was
irreparably
damaged
While
Poland
and
Lithuania
were
growing
in
power
that
of
the
Teutonic
Knights
dwindled
through
infighting
They
were
forced
to
impose
high
taxes
to
pay
a
substantial
indemnity
but
did
not
give
the
cities
sufficient
requested
representation
in
the
administration
of
their
state
The
authoritarian
and
reforming
Grand
Master
Heinrich
von

was
forced
from
power
and
replaced
by
Michael
K
chmeister
von
Sternberg
but
the
new
Grand
Master
was
unable
to
revive
the
Order
s
fortunes
After
the
Gollub
War
the
Knights
lost
some
small
border
regions
and
renounced
all
claims
to
Samogitia
in

1422

the
Prussian
Confederation

the
gentry

of
western
Prussia
rose
up
against
the

beginning
the
Thirteen
Years
War
Much
of
Prussia
was
devastated
in
the
war
during
the
course
of
which
the
Order
returned
Neumark
to
Brandenburg
in

In

1466
the
defeated
Order
recognized
the
Polish
crown
s
rights
over
western
Prussia
subsequently
Royal
Prussia
while
retaining
eastern
Prussia
under
nominal
Polish
overlordship
Because
Marienburg
Castle
was
handed
over
to
mercenaries
in
lieu
of
their
pay
the
Order
moved
its
base
to
K
nigsberg
in
Sambia
After
the
Polish
Teutonic
War
1519
1521
the
Order
was
completely
ousted
from
Prussia
when
Grand
Master
Albert
of
Brandenburg
converted
to
Lutheranism
in
1525
He
secularized
the
Order
s
remaining
Prussian
territories
and
assumed
from
his
uncle
Sigismund
I
the
Old
King
of
Poland
the
hereditary
rights
to
the
Duchy
of
Prussia
as
a
vassal
of
the
Polish
Crown
the
Prussian
Homage
The
Protestant
Duchy
of
Prussia
was
thus
a
fief
of
Catholic
Poland
Although
it
had
lost
control
of
all
of
its
Prussian
lands
the
Teutonic
Order
retained
its
territories
within
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
and
Livonia
although
the
Livonian
branch
retained
considerable
autonomy
Many
of
the
Imperial
possessions
were
ruined
in
the
German
Peasants
War
from
1524
to
1525
and
subsequently
confiscated
by
Protestant
territorial
princes
28
The
Livonian
territory
was
then
partitioned
by
neighboring
powers
during
the
Livonian
War
in
1561
the
Livonian
Master
Gotthard
Kettler
secularized
the
southern
Livonian
possessions
of
the
Order
to
create
the
Duchy
of
Courland
also
a
vassal
of
Poland
After
the
loss
of
Prussia
in
1525
the
Teutonic
Knights
concentrated
on
their
possessions
in
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
Since
they
held
no
contiguous
territory
they
developed
a
three
tiered
administrative
system
holdings
were
combined
into
commanderies
that
were
administered
by
a
commander
Komtur
Several
commanderies
were
combined
to
form
a
bailiwick
headed
by
a
Landkomtur
All
of
the
Teutonic
Knights
possessions
were
subordinate
to
the
Grand
Master
whose
seat
was
in
Bad
Mergentheim
Castle
of
the
Teutonic

in

There
were

were
the
bailiwicks

The
Order
gradually
lost
control
of
these
holdings
until
by
1810
only
the
bailiwicks
in
Tyrol
and
Austria
remained
Following
the
abdication
of

Brandenburg
Walter
von

became
Deutschmeister
in
1527
and
later
Administrator
of
Prussia
and

Emperor
Charles

combined
the
two
positions
in

creating
the
title
Hoch

Deutschmeister
which
also
had
the
rank
of
Prince
of

29
A
new
Grand
Magistery
was
established
in
Mergentheim
in
W
rttemberg
which
was
attacked
during
the
German
Peasants
War
The

also
helped
Charles
V
against
the
Schmalkaldic
League
After

Augsburg
in

membership
in
the
Order
was
open
to
Protestants
although
the
majority
of
brothers
remained
Catholic

The
Teutonic
Knights
became
tri

with

Lutheran
and
Reformed
bailiwicks

often
members

after

Prussia
Livland

the
Holy

of
the
German
Nation
The
highest
officer
of
each
chapter
was
the
Landmeister
country
master
They
were
elected
by
the
regional
chapters
In
the
beginning
they
were
only
substitutes
of
the
Grandmaster
but
were
able
to
create
a
power
of
their
own
so
that

the

could
not

against

Because
the
properties
of
the
order
within

rule
of
the
Deutschmeister
did
not
form
a
contiguous
territory
but
were
spread
over

whole
empire
and
parts
of
Europe
there
was
an
additional
regional
structure
the
bailiwick
Kammerbaleien
were
governed
by
the
Grandmaster
himself
Some
of
these

Modern
organisation
edit
The
Roman
Catholic
order
continued
to
exist
in
Austria
out
of
Napoleon
s
reach
From
1804
until
1923
when
Archduke
Eugen
of
Austria
resigned
the
grandmastership
the
order
was
headed
by
members
of
the
Habsburg
dynasty
All
the
subsequent
Grand
Masters
were
priests
In
1929
that
branch
of
the
Teutonic
knights
was
converted
to
a
purely
spiritual
Roman
Catholic
religious
order
and
renamed
the
Deutscher
Orden
German
Order
citation
needed
After
Austria
s
annexation
by
Nazi
Germany
in
1938
the
Teutonic
Order
was
suppressed
throughout
the
Gro
deutsches
Reich
until
defeat
of
that
regime
although
the
Nazis
used
imagery
of
the
medieval
Teutonic
knights
for
propagandistic
purposes
33
The
Roman
Catholic
order
survived
in
Italy
however
and
was
reconstituted
in
Germany
and
Austria
in
1945
By
the
end
of
the
20th
century
this
part
of
the
Order
had
developed
into
a
charitable
organization
and
established
numerous
clinics
as
well
as
sponsoring
excavation
and
tourism
projects
in
Israel
In
2000
the
German
chapter
of
the
Teutonic
Order
declared
bankruptcy
and
its
upper
management
was
dismissed
an
investigation
by
a
special
committee
of
the
Bavarian
parliament
in
2002
and
2003
to
determine
the
cause
was
inconclusive
The
Catholic
branch
now
consists
of
approximately
1
000
members
including
100
Roman
Catholic
priests
200
nuns
and
700
associates
While
the
priests
are
organized
into
six
provinces
Austria
the
Czech
Republic
Germany
Italy
Slovakia
and
Slovenia
and
predominantly
provide
spiritual
guidance
the
nuns
primarily
care
for
the
ill
and
the
aged
Associates
are
active
in
Austria
Belgium
the
Czech
Republic
Germany
and
Italy
Many
of
the
priests
care
for
German
speaking
communities
outside
of
Germany
and
Austria
especially
in
Italy
and
Slovenia
in
this
sense
the
Teutonic
Order
has
returned
to
its
12th
century
roots
the
spiritual
and
physical
care
of
Germans
in
foreign
lands
34
The
current
General
Abbot
of
the
Order
who
also
holds
the
title
of
Grand
Master
is
Bruno
Platter
The
current
seat
of
the
Grand
Master
is
the
Deutschordenskirche
Church
of
the
German
Order
in
Vienna
35
Near
the
Stephansdom
in
the
Austrian
capital
is
the
Treasury
of
the
Teutonic
Order
which
is
open
to
the
public
and
the
Order
s
Central
Archive
Since
1996
there
has
also
been
a
museum
dedicated
to
the
Teutonic
Knights
at
their
former
castle
in
Bad

A

account
attributes
its
introduction
to
Louis
IX
of
France
who
on
20
August
1250
granted
the
master
of
the
order
this
cross
as
a
variation
of
the
Jerusalem
cross
with
the
fleur

symbol
attached
to

While
this
legendary
account
cannot
be
traced
back
further
than
the

modern
period
Christoph
Hartknoch

there
is

the
design
does
indeed
date
to
the
mid

Protestant
Bailiwick

A

more
of
the

the

its

resembles
that
of

Influence

policy
40
unreliable
source
The
German
historian
Heinrich
von
Treitschke
used
imagery
of
the
Teutonic
Knights
to
promote
pro
German
and
anti
Polish
rhetoric
Many
middle
class
German
nationalists
adopted
this
imagery
and
its
symbols
During
the
Weimar
Republic
associations
and
organisations
of
this
nature
contributed
to
laying
the
groundwork
for
the
formation
of
Nazi
Germany
40
unreliable
source
Before
and
during
World
War
II
Nazi
propaganda
and
ideology
made
frequent
use
of
the
Teutonic
Knights
imagery
as
the
Nazis
sought
to
depict
the
Knights
actions
as
a
forerunner
of
the
Nazi
conquests
for
Lebensraum
Heinrich
Himmler
tried
to
idealise
the
SS
as
a
20th
century
re
incarnation
of
the
medieval
Order
41
Yet
despite
these
references
to
the
Teutonic
Order
s
history
in
Nazi
propaganda
the
Order
itself
was
abolished
in
1938
and
its
members
were
persecuted
by
the
German
authorities
This
occurred
mostly
due
to
Hitler
s
and
Himmler
s
belief
that
throughout
history
Roman
Catholic
military
religious
orders
had
been
tools
of
the
Holy
See
and
as
such
constituted
a
threat
to
the
Nazi
regime
42
The
converse
was
true
for
Polish
nationalism
see
Sienkiewicz
The
Knights
of
the
Cross
which
used
the
Teutonic
Knights
as
symbolic
shorthand
for
Germans
in
general
conflating
the
two
into
an
easily
recognisable
image
of
the
hostile
Similar
associations
were
used
by
Soviet
propagandists
such
as
the

History
edit
In
the
years
between
1806
and
1808
the
Kingdom
of
Bavaria
was
divided
into
15
administrative
districts
whose
names
were
taken
from
the
local
rivers
The
Rezatkreis
was
bordered
in
the
north
by
the
Bavarian
Mainkreis
Obermainkreis
after
1817
in
the
east
by
the
Pegnitzkreis
and
the
Altm
hlkreis
until
1810
in
the
south
by
the
Bavarian
Oberdonaukreis
and
in
the
west
by
the
W
rttemberger
Jagstkreis
In
1817
the
number
of
districts
was
reduced
from
eight
to
seven
with
the
Rheinpfalz
The
Pegnitzkreis
and
the
northern
part
of
the
former
Altm
hlkreis
which
had
belonged
since
1810
to
the
Oberdonaukreis
were
added
to
the
Rezatkreis
Anspach
was
the
district
capital
Kreisstadt
At
the
request
of
King
Ludwig
I
the
Territorial
Reorganization
Gebietsreform
was
made
on
29
November
1837
Consequently
on
1
January
1838
the
Rezatkreis
became
Mittelfranken
Upper
Franconia
one
of
the
seven
current
Regierungsbezirke
of
the

Background
edit
The
first
reports
from
England
over
the
planning
of
railways
attracted
great
attention
in
Germany
particularly
in
Bavaria
where
the
road
between
the
important
commercial
cities
of
Nuremberg
and
F
rth
was
the
busiest
road
connection
in
the
kingdom
Bavarian
interest
was
also
stimulated
by
Friedrich
List
s
advocacy
of
an
all
German
railway
system
and
the
reports
of
Joseph
von
Baader
whom
King
Ludwig
had
sent
to
England
to
study
railways
After
a
discussion
of
this
topic
in
the
first
Bavarian
parliament
in
1825
it
authorised
the
king
to
build
an
experimental
railway
in
the
Nymphenburg
Palace
park
As
the
king
s
1828
request
for
Franconian
merchants
to
begin
building
a
railway
line
led
to
no
action
he
turned
his
attention
to
his
favourite
project
the
building
of
the
Ludwig
Canal
between
the
Danube
and
the
Main
Establishment
edit
After
railways
had
been
operating
in
England
for
a
few
years
local
businesspeople
decided
to
build
a
railway
line
along
the
N
rnberg
F
rth
road
On
14
May
1833
they
founded
the
Gesellschaft
zur
Errichtung
einer
Eisenbahn
mit
Dampffahrt
zwischen
N
rnberg
und
F
rth
company
for
the
establishment
of
a
steam
railway
between
Nuremberg
and
F
rth
to
develop
the
railway
Within
six
months
the
two
main
instigators
from
Nuremberg
the
merchant
and
market
chief
George
Zacharias
Platner
and
the
head
of
the
poly
technical
school
Johannes
Scharrer
had
successfully
raised
the
planned
share
capital
of
132
000
guilders
The
proposed
dividend
of
12
2
3
was
met
with
skepticism
although
the
company
did
in
fact
pay
a
dividend
of
20
in
1836
King
Ludwig
was
an
unenthusiastic
supporter
of
railways
because
of
his
preference
for
building
the
Ludwig
Canal
between
the
Main
and
the
Danube
this
was
actually
built
between
1836
and
1846
The
canal
was
relatively
unsuccessful
because
of
its
profusion
of
locks
its
narrowness
and
early
competition
from
railways
but
it
foreshadowed
the
more
successful
Rhine
Main
Danube
Canal
built
on
a
similar
route
and
completed
in
1992
Ludwig
allowed
the
railway
company
to
use
his
name
and
authorized
his
government
to
buy
a
token
two
shares
in
it
Significantly
for
the
construction
of
the
railway
the
king
made
available
the
Bavarian
road
builder
Paul
Camille
von
Denis
for
the
railway
construction
Von
Denis
adopted
the
English
rail
gauge
of
1435
mm
for
the
nearly
dead
straight
6
04
km
long
single
track
line
next
to
the
F
rth
Nuremberg
road
Start
of
services
edit
On
7
December
1835
the
company
opened
the
first
German
steam
powered
railway
line
for
passenger
and
freight
traffic
before
a
large
public
gathering
The
steam
locomotive
Adler
eagle
had
been
supplied
with
its
driver
by
Stephenson
s
company
from
Newcastle
The
Remy
Co
aus
Rasselstein
company
of
Neuwied
supplied
only
the
15
foot
4
6
m
long
rails
of
rolled
wrought
iron
The
carriages
were
supplied
by
local
wagon
builders
Already
on
20
September
1831
the
private
narrow
gauge
horse
drawn
Prince
William
Railway
coal
railway
had
opened
between
Hinsbeck
Ruhr
and
Nierenhof
but
it
did
not
excite
the
public
attention
of
a
steam
hauled
and
passenger
railway
Nevertheless
King
Ludwig
did
not
visit
the
railway
named
after
him
until
August
1836
The
cost
of
building
the
railway
which
had
been
estimated
at
132
000
guilders
actually
reached
170
000
guilders
as
a
result
of
lack
of
railway
building
experience
and
in
particular
the
high
price
of
land
acquisition
in
the
absence
of
a
law
providing
for
compulsory
purchase
Operations
edit
Beginning
on
8
December
1835
a
horse
drawn
services
operated
on
the
line
from
Nuremberg
to
F
rth
once
an
hour
The
Adler
only
operated
at
13
00
and
14
00
daily
The
high
cost
of
importing
hard
coal
from
Saxony
which
in
the
beginning
still
had
to
be
brought
by
horse
cart
prevented
in
the
early
years
regular
use
of
the
Adler
or
the
Pfeil
arrow
With
the
acquisition
of
more
locomotives
only
the
early
and
late
services
were
horses
drawn
Finally
in
1863
horse
operations
were
abandoned
to
reduce
maintenance
costs
especially
the
provision
of
horse
tracks
and
to
raise
speeds
Goods
traffic
at
first
consisted
of
the
carriage
of
newspapers
and
beer
General
freight
traffic
only
started
in
1839
and
mail
traffic
in
1840
The
success
of
the
line
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
up
to
1855
dividends
were
never
less
than
12
At
the
time
this
was
considered
a
magnificent
capital
return
Nevertheless
the
government
refused
permission
to
extend
the
line
to
W
rzburg
Closure
edit
Competition
developed
with
the
building
of
horse
trams
between
Nuremberg
and
F
rth
particularly
once
they
were
electrified
in
1898
From
1893
part
of
the
line
was
double
tracked
but
this
was
never
completed
Traffic
and
profits
fell
constantly
The
Ludwigsbahn
closed
on
31
October
1922
The
old
station
building
in
F
rth
was
torn
down
in
1938
to
make
room
for
a
Nazi
Party
parade
ground
now
a
plaza
called
F
rther
Freiheit
Furth
Liberty
The
Nuremberg
station
was
demolished
in
1952
to
allow
the
construction
of
a
new
multistory
building
The
line
was
leased
to
the
Nuremberg
tramways
and
trams
operated
on
it
until
1981
It
was
proposed
to
develop
it
as
a
high
speed
tramway
between
N
rnberg
and
F
rth
but
this
was
only
achieved
in
the
1970s
and
1980s
with
the
construction
of
part
of
line
U1
of
the
Nuremberg
U
Bahn
along
the
route
partly
underground
and
partly
elevated
This
was
opened
to
F
rth
station
on
5
December
1985
150
years
after
the
opening
of
the
original
line
The
line
ran
from
the
Nuremberg
station
in
Pl
rrer
place
along
today
s
F
rther
Stra
e
past
the
boundary
with
F
rth
and
then
followed
the
present
Hornschuchpromenade
to
the
Ludwig
station
at

100

Locomotives

possessed

locomotives
during
its

years
of

The
Zollverein
ts
lf
a
n
or
German
Customs
Union
was
a
coalition
of
German
states
formed
to
manage
tariffs
and
economic
policies
within
their
territories
Organized
by
the
1833
Zollverein
treaties
the
Zollverein
formally
started
on
1
January
1834
However
its
foundations
had
been
in
development
from
1818
with
the
creation
of
a
variety
of
custom
unions
among
the
German
states
By
1866
the
Zollverein
included
most
of
the
German
states
The
foundation
of
the
Zollverein
was
the
first
instance
in
history
in
which
independent
states
had
consummated
a
full
economic
union
without
the
simultaneous
creation
of
a
political
federation
or
union
1
Prussia
was
the
primary
driver
behind
the
creation
of
the
customs
union
Austria
was
excluded
from
the
Zollverein
because
of
its
highly
protected
industry
and
also
because
Prince
von
Metternich
was
against
the
idea
By
the
founding
of
the
North
German
Confederation
in
1867
the
Zollverein
covered
states
of
approximately
425
000
square
kilometres
and
had
produced
economic
agreements
with
several
non
German
states
including
Sweden
Norway
After
the
founding
of
the
German
Empire
in
1871
the
Empire
assumed
the
control
of
the
customs
union
However
not
all
states
within
the
Empire
were
part
of
the
Zollverein
until
1888
Conversely
Luxembourg
was
independent
and
not
a
state
in
the
German
Reich
it
remained
in
the
Zollverein
until
1919

Holy
Roman
Empire
and
German
mediatization
Map
of
the
south
German
states
and
province
of
Hohenzollern
At
the
turn
of
the
19th
century
this
group
of
territories
was
transformed
into
three
larger
powers
Baden
W
rttemberg
and
Bavaria
The
splintering
of
territory
and
states
over
generations
meant
that
by
the
1790s
in
the
German
speaking
Holy
Roman
Empire
in
Central
Europe
there
were
approximately
1800
customs
barriers
Even
within
the
Prussian
state
itself
there
were
at
the
beginning
of
the
19th
century
more
than
67
local
customs
and
tariffs
with
as
many
customs
borders
To
travel
from
K
nigsberg
in
East
Prussia
to
Cologne
for
example
a
shipment
was
inspected
and
taxed
18
times
2
Each
customs
inspection
at
each
border
slowed
the
shipment
s
progress
from
source
to
destination
and
each
assessment
on
the
shipment
reduced
profit
and
increased
the
price
of
goods
dramatically
stifling
trade
When
France
defeated
the
Second
Coalition
made
up
of
Russian
Austrian
and
German
forces
and
annexed
territories
up
to
the
Rhine
there
was
a
general
consolidation
of
the
myriad
of
tiny
states
in
Germany
in
the
Mediatization
of
1803
This
was
also
called
the
Principal
Conclusion
of
the
Extraordinary
Imperial
Delegation
or
in
German
Hauptschluss
der
au
erordentlichen
Reichsdeputation
usually
called
the
Reichsdeputationshauptschluss
This
last
piece
of
major
legislation
enacted
by
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
re
arranged
the
map
of
Central
Europe
especially
in
the
southwestern
territories
The
Reichshauptschluss
resulted
in
the
secularization
of
many
ecclesiastical
territories
and
the
so
called
mediatization
i
e
the
annexation
to
larger
neighboring
territories
of
many
of
the
formerly
free
imperial
territories
including
most
of
the
imperial
cities
Considerable
portions
of
the
Habsburg
family
territories
in
southwestern
Central
Europe
were
mediatized
or
given
as
compensation
to
the
princes
and
dukes
who
had
lost
territories
in
the
French
expansion
Most
of
the
imperial
cities
imperial
abbeys
and
ecclesiastical
states
and
cities
were
mediatized
or
secularized
in
1803
With
the
final
dissolution
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
in
1806
most
of
the
remaining
tiny
principalities
were
annexed
by
larger
neighbors
Historians
have
analyzed
three
Prussian
goals
in
the
development
of
the
Zollverein
first
as
a
political
tool
to
eliminate
Austrian
influence
in
Germany
second
as
a
way
to
improve
the
economies
and
third
to
strengthen
Germany
against
potential
French
aggression
while
reducing
the
economic
independence
of
smaller
states
3
The
Zollverein
created
a
larger
market
for
German
made
farm
and
handicraft
products
and
promoted
commercial
unification
under
fiscally
sound
economic
parameters
While
the
Union
sought
to
limit
trade
and
commercial
barriers
between
and
among
member
states
it
continued
to
uphold
the
protectionist
barriers
against
outsiders
Initial
efforts
at
a
single
toll
system
edit
During
the
Napoleonic
Era
efforts
in
the
Rhineland
toward
economic
unity
had
mixed
success
The
Confederation
of
the
Rhine
and
the
other
satellite
creations
of
Napoleonic
France
sought
to
establish
economic
autarky
in
European
trade
By
1806
as
Napoleon
I
sought
to
secure
his
hegemony
in
Europe
the
Continental
System
offered
a
semblance
of
unified
effort
toward
a
widespread
domestic
market
for
European
goods
However
the
main
purpose
of
the
Continental
System
was
military
not
economic
Napoleon
wanted
a
trade
embargo
against
Britain
through
which
he
hoped
to
wreck
the
British
economy
The
combination
of
war
and
isolation
from
Britain
s
trading
system
destroyed
markets
for
external
raw
materials
and
for
manufactured
goods
resulting
in
the
near
ruin
of
the
Central
European
economy
Especially
hard
hit
were
the
trading
economies
of
the
Lowlands
and
Rhineland
states
which
had
relied
heavily
upon
imports
of
raw
materials
from
throughout
the
world
and
on
the
export
of
finished
products
The
domestic
markets
in
Central
Europe
were
not
large
enough
to
sustain
consumption
of
their
own
production
These
problems
were
dramatically
exacerbated
by
the
numerous
excise
taxes
and
tolls
which
were
the
main
source
of
state
income
Reduction
in
trade
meant
the
near
bankruptcy
of
the
smaller
states
4
At
the
Congress
of
Vienna
in
1814
and
1815
diplomats
principally
those
from
the
Great
Powers
confirmed
the
remapping
of
Europe
and
broadly
the
rest
of
the
world
into
spheres
of
influence
Central
Europe
or
German
speaking
Europe
remained
largely
within
the
influence
of
the
Austrian
Habsburgs
balanced
at
the
periphery
by
the
Russian
empire
in
the
east
and
the
French
in
the
west
Prussia
was
expected
to
play
some
role
in
these
spheres
of
influence
but
the
ambiguities
of
the
Austrian
and
Prussian
relationship
were
unresolved
The
German
states
retained
autonomy
however
the
old
imperial
institution
of
the
Reichstag
was
converted
to
the
form
of
a
Confederation
Diet
to
meet
in
Frankfurt
The
Habsburg
archdukes
now
Emperors
of
Austria
were
to
serve
as
permanent
presidents
of
this
institution
Isolated
voices
such
as
Joseph
G
rres
and
Freiherr
vom
Stein
called
for
the
abolition
of
domestic
tolls
and
the
creation
of
a
German
tariff
on
imports
5
The
mandate
from
the
Vienna
Congress
however
established
the
German
Confederation
but
did
not
deal
with
the
economic
circumstances
nor
did
it
make
any
effort
to
achieve
economic
and
trade
standardization
Instead
the
articles
that
established
the
Confederation
suggested
that
trade
and
transportation
questions
be
discussed
at
a
later
date

Problems
with
unifying
the
customs
and
toll
agreements
edit
Prussia
and
the
central
and
southwestern
states
of
Hesse
Nassau
and
Hesse
Darmstadt
W
rttemberg
Baden
and
Bavaria
were
leaders
in
the
modernization
of
the
toll
system
within
the
German
states
In
the
Prussian
case
the
experience
of
the
Confederation
of
the
Rhine
in
removing
customs
barriers
offered
an
example
of
how
it
could
be
done
and
Hans
Count
von
B
low
who
until
1811
had
been
the
Finance
Minister
in
Westphalia
and
who
had
accepted
this
position
in
1813
in
Prussia
modeled
the
Prussian
customs
statutes
on
those
of
the
former
states
of
the
Confederation
The
addition
of
territory
to
the
existing
Prussian
state
made
elimination
of
customs
barriers
a
powerful
factor
in
Prussian
politics
The
significant
differences
between
old
Prussia
and
the
newly
acquired
territories
complicated
the
debate
The
newer
Prussian
provinces
in
the
Rhineland
and
Westphalia
with
their
developing
manufacturing
sectors
contended
with
the
heavily
agricultural
territories
of
old
Prussia
The
dissimilarities
in
the
two
sides
of
Prussia
confirmed
regional
perceptions
for
the
need
for
their
own
political
and
administrative
units
which
became
an
important
element
of
the
customs
debate
Within
old
Prussia
itself
the
customs
statutes
from
1818
reduced
domestic
customs
barriers
After
1818
goods
coming
into
Prussia
and
leaving
Prussia
were
charged
a
high
tariff
Goods
moved
freely
within
the
state
itself
The
Prussian
toll
was
therefore
very
simple
and
efficient
Manufactured
goods
were
heavily
taxed
especially
textiles
and
the
most
important
taxes
were
for
food
necessities
and
luxury
goods
Similarly
in
the
southwest
German
states
it
became
urgent
to
integrate
the
newly
acquired
territories
into
the
states
existing
economic
systems
7
The
territorial
growth
of
the
southwestern
middle
sized
states
in
particular
the
two
Hessian
principalities
but
also
the
growth
of
Baden
and
W
rttemberg
had
split
the
territorial
continuity
of
Prussia
the
Prussian
state
was
no
longer
linked
entirely
by
territory
but
rather
was
separated
from
many
of
its
newer
acquisitions
by
territories
newly
acquired
by
other
states
These
states
often
saw
their
own
interests
as
conflicting
generally
and
specifically
with
Prussian
expansionism
and
resented
Prussian
dominance
and
authority
Furthermore
these
newly
expanded
states
usually
referred
as
middle
sized
states
or
in
German
Mittelstaaten
faced
problems
in
integrating
their
newly
acquired
territories
and
populations
into
an
existing
political
economic
and
legal
structure
These
problems
were
exacerbated
by
European
wide
economic
woes
following
the
Napoleonic
Wars
Unemployment
and
high
prices
especially
for
foodstuffs
characterized
an
economy
not
yet
converted
back
to
peace
time
needs
The
problem
in
Britain
was
particularly
severe
and
the
British
response
created
a
ripple
effect
that
worsened
problems
in
the
German
states
In
trying
to
manage
the
post
war
economy
the
British
government
was
caught
between
the
Malthusian
understanding
of
the
relationship
of
wages
prices
and
population
and
the
Ricardian
model
On
the
one
hand
adherents
to
the
Malthusian
model
believed
it
was
dangerous
for
Britain
to
rely
on
imported
corn
because
lower
prices
would
reduce
wages
and
landlords
and
farmers
would
lose
purchasing
power
8
On
the
other
hand
adherents
to
the
Ricardian
model
thought
that
Britain
could
use
its
capital
and
population
to
advantage
in
a
system
of
free
trade
9
The
problems
in
Britain
established
precedent
for
problems
in
the
German
states
the
British
limitation
on
grain
imports
through
the
Corn
Laws
blocked
economic
recovery
in
the
German
states
particularly
in
eastern
Prussia
by
limiting
the
amount
of
grain
that
could
be
imported
into
Britain
Not
only
did
the
Corn
Laws
keep
the
price
of
grain
in
Britain
high
they
undermined
the
viability
of
Junker
producers
in
east
Prussia
and
limited
their
access
to
external
markets
The
commercial
reform
efforts
sponsored
by
Bavaria
in
1856
led
to
the
General
German
Commercial
Code
in
1861
that
was
quickly
approved
by
a
majority
of
the
confederation
It
proved
highly
successful
in
reducing
barriers
and
increasing
trade

which
was
also
the
ruling
family
of
Prussia
It
was
formed
to
remove
the
various
obstacles
such
as
different
weights
and
measures
in
German
states
to
economic
exchange
and
growth
by
the
new
commercial
classes
creating
a
national
unity
in
economic
matter
at
a
time
when
Germany
was
divided
Surmounting
the
domestic
customs
and
the
individual
states
dependence
on
those
customs
as
their
primary
source
of
income
proved
to
be
a
difficult
problem
The
myriad
of
customs
barriers
restricted
trade
and
hampered
the
industrial
development
but
the
rulers
of
the
states
were
reluctant
to
forgo
their
income
from
the
customs
The
impasse
was
overcome
through
external
forces
With
the
repeal
of
the
Continental
System
the
German
tradesmen
stood
in
direct
conflict
with
the
English
industry
A
united
German
Trade
and
Tradesmens
Union
demanded
protection
from
English
exports
Their
spokesman
the
economist
Friedrich
List
feared
that
the
German
people
would
end
up
as
drawers
of
water
and
hewers
of
wood
for
Britain
10
Similarly
Karl
Friedrich
Nebenius
later
president
of
the
Ducal
Ministry
in
the
Grand
Duchy
of
Baden
and
the
author
of
Baden
s
1819
proposed
customs
initiative
with
the
German
Confederation
offered
a
widely
publicized
description
about
the
difficulties
of
surmounting
such
protections
The
830
toll
barriers
in
Germany
cripple
domestic
traffic
and
bring
more
or
less
the
same
results
how
if
every
limb
of
the
human
body
were
bound
together
so
that
blood
could
not
flow
from
one
limb
to
the
other
In
order
to
trade
from
Hamburg
to
Austria
from
Berlin
to
the
Swiss
Cantons
one
must
cut
through
the
statutes
of
ten
states
study
ten
tolls
and
toll
barriers
ten
times
go
through
the
toll
barriers
and
ten
times
pay
the
tolls
Who
but
the
unfortunate
has
to
negotiate
such
borders
To
live
with
such
borders
Where
three
or
four
states
collide
there
one
must
live
his
whole
life
under
evil
senseless
tolls
and
toll
restrictions
That
is
no
Fatherland
11
In
1820
W
rttemberg
planned
to
start
a
customs
union
among
the
so
called
Third
Germany
the
middle
sized
German
states
including
itself
Baden
Bavaria
and
the
two
Hessian
states
Hesse
Darmstadt
and
Hesse
Kassel
This
customs
union
excluded
both
Austria
and
Prussia
primarily
because
the
two
major
German
powers
were
considered
too
overbearing
Plans
foundered
on
the
differing
interests
of
the
affected
states
While
the
economic
development
in
Baden
proceeded
relatively
well
with
its
long
borders
and
well
entrenched
infrastructure
for
trade
economic
development
in
Bavaria
lagged
well
behind
it
and
the
Bavarian
regime
enacted
a
protective
tariff
on
goods
produced
outside
its
border
The
result
was
a
short
lived
trade
agreement
between
Baden
and
Hesse
Darmstadt
Nevertheless
a
second
agreement
reached
in
Stuttgart
in
1825
established
rapport
between
W
rttemberg
and
Bavaria
with
the
foundation
of
the
South
German
Customs
Union
In
opposition
to
the
Prussian
activities
Hanover
Saxony
Hesse
and
other
states
Austria
France
Great
Britain
and
the
Netherlands
developed
their
own
economic
agreements
While
they
promised
one
another
not
to
join
the
Prussian
union
they
did
develop
trade
agreements
of
their
own
The
Union
remained
unsuccessful
because
it
only
sought
to
maintain
the
status
quo
not
to
fix
the
problems
created
by
toll
barriers
12
In
1834
Baden
and
W
rttemberg
joined
the
Prussian
union
which
was
renamed
the
German
Customs
Union
By
1835
the
German
Customs
Union
had
expanded
to
include
the
majority
of
the
states
of
the
German
Confederation
even
Saxony
the
Thuringian
states
W
rttemberg
and
Baden
Bavaria
and
the
Hessian
states
Functionally
it
removed
many
internal
customs
barriers
while
upholding
a
protectionist
tariff
system
with
foreign
trade
partners

Impact

Economic
impact

According
to
one
study
The
Zollverein
was
the
most
important
institutional
development
for
Germany
s
economic
unification
during
the
middle
of
the
19th
century
It
had
a
strong
impact
on
regional
development
changing
regional
fortunes
by
the
opening
and
closing
of
markets

Role
in
the
unification
of
Germany
edit
Main
article
Unification
of
Germany
According
to
some
economic
historians
such
as
Helmut
B
hme
and
H
U
Wehler
the
Zollverein
set
the
groundwork
for
the
unification
of
Germany
under
Prussian
guidance
This
traditional
view
is
disputed
by
historians
such
as
Hans
Joachim
Voth
who
contend
that
far
from
allowing
Prussia
to
increase
its
political
influence
over
the
smaller
states
the
customs
union
may
have
had
the
contrary
effect
many
governments
used
the
increased
revenue
brought
by
the
customs
union
to
try
to
consolidate
their
independence
The
smaller
states
entered
the
customs
union
for
purely
fiscal
reasons
and
as
the
events
of
1866
were
to
demonstrate
membership
in
the
Zollverein
did
not
in
the
least
lead
to
any
form
of
political
commitment
toward
Berlin
as
many
states
remained
suspicious
of
Prussia
and
generally
pro
Austrian
15
The
impact
of
the
Zollverein
on
German
unification
may
have
been
more
incidental
As
it
constituted
the
main
feature
of
Berlin
s
German
policy
for
many
years
Prussian
ministers
and
other
government
officials
became
accustomed
to
think
in
terms
of
Germany
as
a
whole
and
to
look
beyond
specifically
Prussian
benefits
when
looking
for
a
consensus
across
Germany
16
According
to
revisionist
historians
the
Zollverein
may
not
even
have
been
instrumental
in
bringing
about
Prussia
s
economic
preeminence
in
Germany
They
argue
that
nothing
seems
to
indicate
that
industrial
investments
increased
decisively
during
the
period
in
Prussia
or
that
the
customs
union
played
a
significant
role
in
reducing
the
dominance
of
agriculture
in
the
kingdom
s
economy

History
and
purpose
edit
The
first
Nazi
Party
rallies
took
place
in
1923
in
Munich
and
in
1926
in
Weimar
From
1927
on
they
took
place
exclusively
in
Nuremberg
The
Party
selected
Nuremberg
for
pragmatic
reasons
it
was
in
the
center
of
the
German
Reich
and
the
local
Luitpoldhain
converted
parkland
was
well
suited
as
a
venue
In
addition
the
Nazis
could
rely
on
the
well
organized
local
branch
of
the
party
in
Franconia
then
led
by
Gauleiter
Julius
Streicher
The
Nuremberg
police
were
sympathetic
to
the
event
Later
the
location
was
justified
by
the
Nazi
Party
by
putting
it
into
the
tradition
of
the
Imperial
Diet
German
Reichstag
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
considered
the
First
Reich
After
1933
the
rallies
took
place
near
the
time
of
the
Autumnal
equinox
under
the
title
of
The
German
people
s
National
Party
days
Reichsparteitage
des
deutschen
Volkes
which
was
intended
to
symbolize
the
solidarity
between
the
German
people
and
the
Nazi
Party
This
point
was
further
emphasized
by
the
yearly
growing
number
of
participants
which
finally
reached
over
half
a
million
from
all
sections
of
the
party
the
army
and
the
state

The

Propaganda
films
edit
Official
films
for
the
rallies
began
in
1927
with
the
establishment
of
the
NSDAP
Nazi
Party
film
office
The
most
famous
films
were
made
by
Leni
Riefenstahl
for
the
rallies
between
1933
and
1935
Relating
to
the
theme
of
the
rally
she
called
her
first
movie
Victory
of
Faith
Der
Sieg
des
Glaubens
This
movie
was
taken
out
of
circulation
after
the
Night
of
the
Long
Knives
although
a
copy
survived
in
Britain
and
has
recently
been
made
available
on
the
Internet

for
public
viewing
The
rally
of
1934
became
the
setting
for
the
award
winning
Triumph
of
the
Will
Triumph
des
Willens
Several
generals
in
the
Wehrmacht
protested
over
the
minimal
army
presence
in
the
film
Hitler
apparently
proposed
modifying
the
film
to
placate
the
generals
but
Riefenstahl
refused
his
suggestion
She
did
agree
to
return
to
the
1935
rally
and
make
a
film
exclusively
about
the
Wehrmacht
which
became
Tag
der
Freiheit
Unsere
Wehrmacht
The
rallies
for
1936
and
1937
were
covered
in
Festliches
N
rnberg
which
was
shorter
than
the
others
only
21
minutes
Books
edit
There
were
two
sets
of
official
or
semi
official
books
covering
the
rallies
The
red
books
were
officially
published
by
the
NSDAP
and
contained
the
proceedings
of
the
congress
as
well
as
full
texts
of
every
speech
given
in
chronological
order
The
blue
books
were
published
initially
by
Julius
Streicher
the
Gauleiter
of
Nuremberg
later
by
Hanns
Kerrl
not
by
the
party
press
These
were
larger
scale
books
that
included
the
text
of
speeches
and
proceedings
as
well
as
larger
photographs
In
addition
to
these
collections
of
Heinrich
Hoffman
s
photographs
were
published
to
commemorate
each
Party
congress
as
well
as
pamphlets
of
Hitler
s
speeches
Both
series
of
books
are
much
sought
after
collectors

governed
by
a
dictatorship
under
the
control
of
Adolf

and
the
Nazi
Party
NSDAP
Under
Hitler
s
rule
Germany
was
transformed
into
a
totalitarian
state
in
which
the
Nazi
Party
controlled
nearly
all
aspects
of
life
The
official
name
of
the
state
was
Deutsches

from
1933
to
1943
and
Gro

from
1943
to

opposition
and
consolidate
its
power
Hindenburg
died
on

A
national
referendum
held
19
August
1934
confirmed
Hitler

s
person
and
his
word
became
above
all
laws
The
government
was
not
a
coordinated
co
operating
body
but
a
collection
of
factions
struggling
for
power
and
Hitler
s
favour
In
the
midst
of
the
Great
Depression
the
Nazis
restored
economic
stability
and
ended
mass
unemployment
using
heavy
military
spending
and
a
mixed
economy
Extensive
public
works
were
undertaken
including
the
construction
of
Autobahnen
motorways
The
return
to
economic
stability
boosted
the
regime
s
popularity
Racism
especially
antisemitism
was
a
central
feature
of
the
regime
The
Germanic
peoples
the
Nordic
race
were
considered
by
the
Nazis
to
be
the
purest
branch
of
the
Aryan
race
and
were
therefore
viewed
as
the
master
race
Millions
of
Jews
and
other
peoples
deemed
undesirable
by
the
state
were
murdered
in
the
Holocaust
Opposition
to
Hitler
s
rule
was
ruthlessly
suppressed
Members
of
the
liberal
socialist
and
communist
opposition
were
killed
imprisoned
or
exiled
Christian
churches
were
also
oppressed
with
many
leaders
imprisoned
Education
focused
on
racial
biology
population
policy
and
fitness
for
military
service
Career
and
educational
opportunities
for
women
were
curtailed
Recreation
and
tourism
were
organised
via
the
Strength
Through
Joy
program
and
the
1936
Summer
Olympics
showcased
the
Third
Reich
on
the
international
stage
Propaganda
minister
Joseph
Goebbels
made
effective
use
of
film
mass
rallies
and
Hitler
s
hypnotic
oratory
to
influence
public
opinion
The
government
controlled
artistic
expression
promoting
specific
art
forms
and
banning
or
discouraging
others
Beginning
in
the
late
1930s
Nazi
Germany
made
increasingly
aggressive
territorial
demands
threatening
war
if
they
were
not
met
It
seized
Austria
and
Czechoslovakia
in
1938
and
1939
Hitler
made
a
non
aggression
pact
with
Joseph
Stalin
and
invaded
Poland
in
September
1939
launching
World
War
II
in
Europe
In
alliance
with
Italy
and
smaller
Axis
powers
Germany
conquered
most
of
Europe
by
1940
and
threatened
Great
Britain
Reichskommissariats
took
control
of
conquered
areas
and
a
German
administration
was
established
in
what
was
left
of
Poland
Jews
and
others
deemed
undesirable
were
imprisoned
murdered
in
Nazi
concentration
camps
and
extermination
camps
or
shot
Following
the
German
invasion
of
the
Soviet
Union
in
1941
the
tide
gradually
turned
against
the
Nazis
who
suffered
major
military
defeats
in
1943
Large
scale
aerial
bombing
of
Germany
escalated
in
1944
and
the
Axis
powers
were
pushed
back
in
Eastern
and
Southern
Europe
Following
the
Allied
invasion
of
France
Germany
was
conquered
by
the
Soviet
Union
from
the
east
and
the
other
Allied
powers
from
the
west
and
capitulated
within
a
year
Hitler
s
refusal
to
admit
defeat
led
to
massive
destruction
of
German
infrastructure
and
additional
war
related
deaths
in
the
closing
months
of
the
war
The
victorious
Allies
initiated
a
policy
of
denazification
and
put
many
of
the
surviving
Nazi
leadership
on
trial
for
war
crimes
at
the
Nuremberg
trials

The

was
Deutsches

from
1933
to
1943
and
Gro
deutsches
Reich
from
1943
to
1945
while
common
English
terms
are
Nazi
Germany
and
Third

The
latter
adopted
by
Nazi
propaganda
was
first
used
in
a
1923
book
by
Arthur
Moeller
van

The

counted
the

1806
as
the

and
the
German

1871
1918

Background
Further
information
Adolf
Hitler
s
rise
to
power
The
German
economy
suffered
severe
setbacks
after
the
end
of
World
War
I
partly
because
of
reparations
payments
required
under
the
1919
Treaty
of
Versailles
The
government
printed
money
to
make
the
payments
and
to
repay
the
country
s
war
debt
but
the
resulting
hyperinflation
led
to
inflated
prices
for
consumer
goods
economic
chaos
and
food
riots
2
When
the
government
failed
to
make
the
reparations
payments
in
January
1923
French
troops
occupied
German
industrial
areas
along
the
Ruhr
and
widespread
civil
unrest
followed
3
The
National
Socialist
German
Workers
Party
NSDAP
e
Nazi
Party
was
the
renamed
successor
of
the
German
Workers
Party
founded
in
1919
one
of
several
far
right
political
parties
active
in
Germany
at
the
time
4
The
party
platform
included
removal
of
the
Weimar
Republic
rejection
of
the
terms
of
the
Treaty
of
Versailles
radical
antisemitism
and
anti
Bolshevism
5
They
promised
a
strong
central
government
increased
Lebensraum
living
space
for
Germanic
peoples
formation
of
a
national
community
based
on
race
and
racial
cleansing
via
the
active
suppression
of
Jews
who
would
be
stripped
of
their
citizenship
and
civil
rights
6
The
Nazis
proposed
national
and
cultural
renewal
based
upon
the
V
lkisch
movement
7
When
the
stock
market
in
the
United
States
crashed
on
24
October
1929
the
effect
in
Germany
was
dire
Millions
were
thrown
out
of
work
and
several
major
banks
collapsed
Hitler
and
the
NSDAP
prepared
to
take
advantage
of
the
emergency
to
gain
support
for
their
party
They
promised
to
strengthen
the
economy
and
provide
jobs
8
Many
voters
decided
the
NSDAP
was
capable
of
restoring
order
quelling
civil
unrest
and
improving
Germany
s
international
reputation
After
the
federal
election
of
1932
the
Nazis
were
the
largest
party
in
the
Reichstag
holding
230
seats
with

Although
the
Nazis
won
the
greatest
share
of
the
popular
vote
in
the
two
Reichstag
general
elections
of
1932
they
did
not
have
a
majority
and
therefore
Hitler
led
a
short
lived
coalition
government
formed
by
the
NSDAP
and
the
German
National
People
s
Party
10
Under
pressure
from
politicians
industrialists
and
the
business
community
President
Paul
von
Hindenburg
appointed
Hitler
as
Chancellor
of
Germany
on
30
January
1933
This
event
is
known
as
the
Machtergreifung
seizure
of
power
11
In
the
following
months
the
NSDAP
used
a
process
termed
Gleichschaltung
co
ordination
to
rapidly
bring
all
aspects
of
life
under
control
of
the
party
12
All
civilian
organisations
including
agricultural
groups
volunteer
organisations
and
sports
clubs
had
their
leadership
replaced
with
Nazi
sympathisers
or
party
members
By
June
1933
virtually
the
only
organisations
not
in
the
control
of
the
NSDAP
were
the
army
and
the
churches
13
Adolf
Hitler
became
Germany
s
head
of
state
with
the
title
of
F
hrer
und
Reichskanzler
in
1934
On
the
night
of
27
February
1933
the
Reichstag
building
was
set
afire
and
Marinus
van
der
Lubbe
a
Dutch
communist
was
found
guilty
of
starting
the
blaze
Hitler
proclaimed
that
the
arson
marked
the
start
of
a
communist
uprising
Violent
suppression
of
communists
by
the
Sturmabteilung
SA
was
undertaken
all
over
the
country
and
four
thousand
members
of
the
Communist
Party
of
Germany
were
arrested
The
Reichstag
Fire
Decree
imposed
on
28
February
1933
rescinded
most
German
civil
liberties
including
rights
of
assembly
and
freedom
of
the
press
The
decree
also
allowed
the
police
to
detain
people
indefinitely
without
charges
or
a
court
order
The
legislation
was
accompanied
by
a
propaganda
blitz
that
led
to
public
support
for
the
measure
14
In
March
1933
the
Enabling
Act
an
amendment
to
the
Weimar
Constitution
passed
in
the
Reichstag
by
a
vote
of
444
to
94
15
This
amendment
allowed
Hitler
and
his
cabinet
to
pass
laws
even
laws
that
violated
the
constitution
without
the
consent
of
the
president
or
the
Reichstag
16
As
the
bill
required
a
two
thirds
majority
to
pass
the
Nazis
used
the
provisions
of
the
Reichstag
Fire
Decree
to
keep
several
Social
Democratic
deputies
from
attending
as
the
Communists
had
already
been
banned
17
18
On
10
May
the
government
seized
the
assets
of
the
Social
Democrats
and
they
were
banned
in
June
19
The
remaining
political
parties
were
dissolved
and
on
14
July
1933
Germany
became
a
de
facto
one
party
state
when
the
founding
of
new
parties
was
made
illegal
20
Further
elections
in
November
1933
1936
and
1938
were
entirely
Nazi
controlled
and
saw
only
the
Nazis
and
a
small
number
of
independents
elected
21
The
regional
state
parliaments
and
the
Reichsrat
federal
upper
house
were
abolished
in
January
1934
22
The
Nazi
regime
abolished
the
symbols
of
the
Weimar
Republic
including
the
black
red
and
gold
tricolour
flag
and
adopted
reworked
imperial
symbolism
The
previous
imperial
black
white
and
red
tricolour
was
restored
as
one
of
Germany
s
two
official
flags
the
second
was
the
swastika
flag
of
the
NSDAP
which
became
the
sole
national
flag
in
1935
The
NSDAP
anthem
Horst
Wessel
Lied
Horst
Wessel
Song
became
a
second
national
anthem
23
In
this
period
Germany
was
still
in
a
dire
economic
situation
as
millions
were
unemployed
and
the
balance
of
trade
deficit
was
daunting
24
Hitler
knew
that
reviving
the
economy
was
vital
In
1934
using
deficit
spending
public
works
projects
were
undertaken
A
total
of
1
7
million
Germans
were
put
to
work
on
the
projects
in
1934
alone
24
Average
wages
both
per
hour
and
per
week
began
to
rise
25
The
demands
of
the
SA
for
more
political
and
military
power
caused
anxiety
among
military
industrial
and
political
leaders
In
response
Hitler
purged
the
entire
SA
leadership
in
the
Night
of
the
Long
Knives
which
took
place
from
30
June
to
2
July
1934
26
Hitler
targeted
Ernst
R
hm
and
other
SA
leaders
who
along
with
a
number
of
Hitler
s
political
adversaries
such
as
Gregor
Strasser
and
former
chancellor
Kurt
von
Schleicher
were
rounded
up
arrested
and
shot
27
On
2
August
1934
President
von
Hindenburg
died
The
previous
day
the
cabinet
had
enacted
the
Law
Concerning
the
Highest
State
Office
of
the
Reich
which
stated
that
upon
Hindenburg
s
death
the
office
of
president
would
be
abolished
and
its
powers
merged
with
those
of
the
chancellor
28
Hitler
thus
became
head
of
state
as
well
as
head
of
government
and
he
was
formally
named
as
F
hrer
und
Reichskanzler
leader
and
chancellor
Germany
was
now
a
totalitarian
state
with
Hitler
at
its
head
29
As
head
of
state
Hitler
became
Supreme
Commander
of
the
armed
forces
The
new
law
altered
the
traditional
loyalty
oath
of
servicemen
so
that
they
affirmed
loyalty
to
Hitler
personally
rather
than
the
office
of
supreme
commander
or
the
state
30
On
19
August
the
merger
of
the
presidency
with
the
chancellorship
was
approved
by
90
percent
of
the
electorate
in
a
plebiscite
31
Joseph
Goebbels
Reich
Minister
of
Propaganda
Most
Germans
were
relieved
that
the
conflicts
and
street
fighting
of
the
Weimar
era
had
ended
They
were
deluged
with
propaganda
orchestrated
by
Joseph
Goebbels
who
promised
peace
and
plenty
for
all
in
a
united
Marxist
free
country
without
the
constraints
of
the
Versailles
Treaty
32
The
first
major
Nazi
concentration
camp
initially
for
political
prisoners
was
opened
at
Dachau
in
1933
33
Hundreds
of
camps
of
varying
size
and
function
were
created
by
the
end
of
the
war
34
Upon
seizing
power
the
Nazis
took
repressive
measures
against
their
political
opposition
and
rapidly
began
the
comprehensive
marginalisation
of
persons
they
considered
socially
undesirable
Under
the
guise
of
combating
the
Communist
threat
the
National
Socialists
secured
immense
power
Above
all
their
campaign
against
Jews
living
in
Germany
gained
momentum
Beginning
in
April
1933
scores
of
measures
defining
the
status
of
Jews
and
their
rights
were
instituted
at
the
regional
and
national
level
35
Initiatives
and
legal
mandates
against
the
Jews
reached
their
culmination
with
the
establishment
of
the
Nuremberg
Laws
of
1935
stripping
them
of
their
basic
rights
36
The
Nazis
would
take
from
the
Jews
their
wealth
their
right
to
intermarry
with
non
Jews
and
their
right
to
occupy
many
fields
of
labour
such
as
practising
law
medicine
or
working
as
educators
They
eventually
declared
them
undesirable
to
remain
among
German
citizens
and
society
which
over
time
dehumanised
the
Jews
Arguably
these
actions
desensitised
Germans
to
the
extent
that
it
resulted
in
the
Holocaust
Ethnic
Germans
who
refused
to
ostracise
Jews
or
who
showed
any
signs
of
resistance
to
Nazi
propaganda
were
placed
under
surveillance
by
the
Gestapo
had
their
rights
removed
or
were
sent
to
concentration
camps
37
Everyone
and
everything
was
monitored
in
Nazi
Germany
Inaugurating
and
legitimising
power
for
the
Nazis
was
thus
accomplished
by
their
initial
revolutionary
activities
then
through
the
improvisation
and
manipulation
of
the
legal
mechanisms
available
through
the
use
of
police
powers
by
the
Nazi
Party
which
allowed
them
to
include
and
exclude
from
society
whomever
they
chose
and
finally
by
the
expansion
of
authority
for
all
state
and
federal
institutions

Schuschnigg
scheduled
a

demanded
that
it
be

Hitler
sent
an
ultimatum
to
Schuschnigg
demanding
that
he
hand
over
all
power
to
the

The
Republic
of
Czechoslovakia
was
home
to
a
substantial
minority
of
Germans
who
lived
mostly
in
the
Sudetenland
Under
pressure
from
separatist
groups
within
the
Sudeten
German
Party
the
Czechoslovak
government
offered
economic
concessions
to
the
region
49
Hitler
decided
to
incorporate
not
just
the
Sudetenland
but
the
whole
of
Czechoslovakia
into
the
Reich
50
The

undertook
a

to
try

Attempting
to

British
Prime
Minister
Neville
Chamberlain
arranged
a
series
of
meetings
the
result
of
which
was
the
Munich
Agreement
signed
on
29
September
1938
The
Czechoslovak
government
was
forced
to
accept
the
Sudetenland
s
annexation
into
Germany
Chamberlain
was
greeted
with
cheers
when
he
landed
in
London
bringing
he
said
peace
for
our
time
53
The
agreement
lasted
six
months
before
Hitler
seized
the
rest
of
Czech
territory
in
March
1939
54
A
puppet
state
was
created
in

55
Austrian

Czech
foreign
exchange
reserves
were
soon
seized
by

as
were
stockpiles
of
raw
materials
such
as
metals
and
completed
goods
such
as
weaponry
and
aircraft
which
were
shipped
back
to

In

Germany
signed
a
non

pact
with
Poland
which
disrupted
the
French
network
of
anti

alliances
in

57
In
March
1939
Hitler
demanded
the
return
of
the
Free
City
of
Danzig
and
the
Polish
Corridor
a
strip
of
land
that
separated
East
Prussia
from
the
rest
of
Germany
The
British
announced
they
would
come
to
the
aid
of
Poland
if
it
was
attacked
Hitler
believing
the
British
would
not
actually
take
action
ordered
an
invasion
plan
should
be
readied
for
a
target
date
of
September
1939
58
On
23
May
Hitler
described
to
his
generals
his
overall
plan
of
not
only
seizing
the
Polish
Corridor
but
greatly
expanding
German
territory
eastward
at
the
expense
of
Poland
and
he
expected
this
time
they
would
be
met
by
force
59
The
Germans
reaffirmed
their
alliance
with
Italy
and
signed
non
aggression
pacts
with
Denmark
Estonia
and
Latvia
whilst
trade
links
were
formalised
with
Romania
Norway
and
Sweden
60
Hitler
s
foreign
minister
Joachim
von
Ribbentrop
arranged
in

with
the
Soviet

a

pact
the
Molotov

Pact
which
was
signed
in
August
1939

Foreign
policy
Further
information
Diplomatic
history
of
World

Germany
Germany
s
foreign
policy
during
the
war
involved
the
creation
of
allied
governments
under
direct
or
indirect
control
from
Berlin
A
main
goal
was
obtaining
soldiers
from
the
senior
allies
such
as
Italy
and
Hungary
and
millions
of
workers
and
ample
food
supplies
from
subservient
allies
such
as
Vichy
France
64
By
the
fall
of
1942
there
were
24
divisions
from
Romania
on
the
Eastern
Front
10
from
Italy
and
10
from
Hungary
65
When
a
country
was
no
longer
dependable
Germany
assumed
full
control
as
it
did
with
France
in
1942
Italy
in
1943
and
Hungary
in
1944
Although
Japan
was
an
official
powerful
ally
the
relationship
was
distant
and
there
was
little
co
ordination
or
co
operation
For
example
Germany
refused
to
share
their
formula
for
synthetic
oil
from
coal
until
late
in

Reinhard
Heydrich
then

ordered
on

September
that

should
be
rounded
up
and
concentrated
into
cities
with

Initially
the
intention
was
to

or

to

69
Using

some
65
000
Polish
intelligentsia
noblemen
clergy
and
teachers
were
killed
by
the
end
of
1939
in
an
attempt
to
destroy
Poland
s
identity
as
a
nation
70
71
The
Soviet
forces
continued
to
attack
advancing
into
Finland
in
the
Winter
War
and
German
forces
were
involved
in
action
at
sea
But
little
other
activity
occurred
until
May
so
the
period
became
known
as
the
Phoney
War
72
From
the
start
of
the
war
a
British
blockade
on
shipments
to
Germany
affected
the
Reich
economy
The
Germans
were
particularly
dependent
on
foreign
supplies
of
oil
coal
and
grain
73
To
safeguard
Swedish
iron
ore
shipments
to
Germany
Hitler
ordered
an
attack
on
Norway
which
took
place
on
9
April
1940
Much
of
the
country
was
occupied
by
German
troops
by
the
end
of
April
Also
on
9
April
the
Germans
invaded
and
occupied
Denmark
74
75
Conquest
of
Europe
Against
the
judgement
of
many
of
his
senior
military
officers
Hitler
ordered
an
attack
on
France
and
the
Low
Countries
which
began
in
May
1940
76
They
quickly
conquered
Luxembourg
the
Netherlands
and
Belgium
and
France
surrendered
on
22
June
77
The
unexpectedly
swift
defeat
of
France
resulted
in
an
upswing
in
Hitler
s
popularity
and
a
strong
upsurge
in
war
fever
78
In
spite
of
the
provisions
of
the
Hague
Convention
industrial
firms
in
the
Netherlands
France
and
Belgium
were
put
to
work
producing
war
materiel
for
the
occupying
German
military
Officials
viewed
this
option
as
being
preferable
to
their
citizens
being
deported
to
the
Reich
as
forced
labour
79
The
Nazis
seized
from
the
French
thousands
of
locomotives
and
rolling
stock
stockpiles
of
weapons
and
raw
materials
such
as
copper
tin
oil
and
nickel
80
Financial
demands
were
levied
on
the
governments
of
the
occupied
countries
as
well
and
payments
for
occupation
costs
were
received
from
France
Belgium
and
Norway
81
Barriers
to
trade
led
to
hoarding
black
markets
and
uncertainty
about
the
future
82

areas
of
Europe

83
Hitler
made
peace
overtures
to
the
new
British
leader
Winston
Churchill
and
upon
their
rejection
he
ordered
a
series
of
aerial
attacks
on
Royal
Air
Force
airbases
and
radar
stations
However
the
German
Luftwaffe
failed
to
defeat
the
Royal
Air
Force
in
what
became
known
as
the
Battle
of
Britain
84
By
the
end
of
October
Hitler
realised
the
necessary
air
superiority
for
his
planned
invasion
of
Britain
could
not
be
achieved
and
he
ordered
nightly
air
raids
on
British
cities
including
London
Plymouth
and
Coventry
85
In

this

and
seize
its

for

against
the
Western
powers
90
The
reaction
among
Germans
was
one
of
surprise
and
trepidation
as
many
were
concerned
about
how
much
longer
the
war
would
drag
on
or
suspected
that
Germany
could
not
win
a

After

Hitler
ordered

its
advance
to
Moscow
and
temporarily
divert
its
Panzer
groups
to
aid
in
the
encirclement
of
Leningrad
and
Kiev
92
This
pause
provided
the
Red
Army
with
an
opportunity
to
mobilise
fresh
reserves
The
Moscow
offensive
which
resumed
in
October
1941
ended
disastrously
in
December
92
On

Four

was
in
short
supply
in
the
conquered
areas
of
the
Soviet

and
Poland
with
rations
inadequate
to
meet
nutritional
needs
The

the

was
sent

of

railroad
cars
full
of
art
treasures
furniture
and
other
looted
items
were
sent
back
to

from

96
In

westward
after
the
failed
German

at
the

and
by

many

106
Soon

production
could
not

and
without

the

111
Hitler
s
refusal
to
admit
defeat
and
his
repeated
insistence
that
the
war
be
fought
to
the

led
to
unnecessary
death
and
destruction
in
the
closing
months
of
the
war
112
Through
his
Justice
Minister
Otto
Georg
Thierack
Hitler
ordered
that
anyone
who
was
not
prepared
to
fight
should
be
summarily
court
martialed
and
thousands
of
people
were
put
to
death
113
In

people
looked
for
ways
to
surrender
to
the
approaching
Allies
in
spite
of
exhortations
of

to

Hitler
also

Ideology
Further
information
Nazism
The
NSDAP
was
a
far
right
political
party
which
came
into
its
own
during
the
social
and
financial
upheavals
that
occurred
with
the
onset
of
the
Great
Depression
in
1929
154
While
in
prison
after
the
failed
Beer
Hall
Putsch
of
1923
Hitler
wrote
Mein
Kampf
which
laid
out
his
plan
for
transforming
German
society
into
one
based
on
race
155
The
ideology
of
Nazism
brought
together
elements
of
antisemitism
racial
hygiene
and
eugenics
and
combined
them
with
pan
Germanism
and
territorial
expansionism
with
the
goal
of
obtaining
more
Lebensraum
for
the
Germanic
people
156
The
regime
attempted
to
obtain
this
new
territory
by
attacking
Poland
and
the
Soviet
Union
intending
to
deport
or
kill
the
Jews
and
Slavs
living
there
who
were
viewed
as
being
inferior
to
the
Aryan
master
race
and
part
of
a
Jewish
Bolshevik
conspiracy
157
158
The
Nazi
regime
believed
that
only
Germany
could
defeat
the
forces
of
Bolshevism
and
save
humanity
from
world
domination
by
International
Jewry
159
Others
deemed
life
unworthy
of
life
by
the
Nazis
included
the
mentally
and
physically
disabled
Romani
people
homosexuals
Jehovah
s
Witnesses
and
social
misfits
160
161
Influenced
by
the
V
lkisch
movement
the
regime
was
against
cultural
modernism
and
supported
the
development
of
an
extensive
military
at
the
expense
of
intellectualism

as
the

still
used

for
some
government
departments
such

from

point
forward

appointed

the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
168
Hitler
ruled
Germany
autocratically
by
asserting
the
F
hrerprinzip
leader
principle
which
called
for
absolute
obedience
of
all
subordinates
as
he
viewed
the
government
structure
as
a
pyramid
with
himself
the
infallible
leader
at

apex
Rank
in

to
develop

around
Hitler

Roger
Gill
states
His

he
virtually

173
Top
officials
reported

174
Officials
were

the
F

to
take
the
initiative
in
promoting
policies
and
actions
in
line
with
his
wishes
and
the
goals
of
the
NSDAP
without
Hitler
having
to
be
involved
in
the
day
to
day
running
of
the
country
175
The
government
was
not
a
coordinated
co
operating
body
but
rather
a
disorganised
collection
of
factions
led
by
members
of
the
party
elite
who
struggled
to
amass
power
and
gain
the
F
hrer
s
favour
176
Hitler
s
leadership
style
was
to
give
contradictory
orders
to
his
subordinates
and
to
place
them
in
positions
where
their
duties
and
responsibilities
overlapped
177
In
this
way
he
fostered
distrust
competition
and
infighting
among
his
subordinates
to
consolidate
and
maximise
his
own
power

a

had
been
required
of
members
of

several
weeks

This
law
became
the
basis
of
the
F

the
concept
that
Hitler

overrode
all
existing
laws

Any

that

thus

of

of
three
or
more
offences
even
petty
ones
could
be
deemed
habitual
offenders
and
jailed
indefinitely
183
People
such
as
prostitutes
and
pickpockets
were
judged
to
be
inherently
criminal
and
a
threat

were
arrested

Although
the
regular
courts
handled
political
cases
and
even
issued
death
sentences
for
these
cases
a
new
type
of
court
the
Volksgerichtshof
People
s
Court
was
established
in
1934
to
deal
with
politically
important
matters
185
This
court
handed
out
over
5
000
death
sentences
until
its
dissolution
in
1945
186
The
death
penalty
could
be
issued
for
offences
such
as
being
a
communist
printing
seditious
leaflets
or
even
making
jokes
about
Hitler
or
other
top
party
officials
187
Nazi
Germany
employed
three
types
of
capital
punishment
hanging
decapitation
and
death
by
shooting
188
The
Gestapo
was
in
charge
of
investigative
policing
to
enforce
National
Socialist
ideology
as
they
located
and
confined
political
offenders
Jews
and
others
deemed
undesirable
189
Political
offenders
who
were
released
from
prison
were
often
immediately
re
arrested
by
the
Gestapo
and
confined
in
a
concentration
camp
190
In
September
1935
the
Nuremberg
Laws
were
enacted
These
laws
initially
prohibited
sexual
relations
and
marriages
between
Aryans
and
Jews
and
were
later
extended
to
include
Gypsies
Negroes
or
their
bastard
offspring
191
The
law
also
forbade
the
employment
of
German
women
under
the
age
of
45
as
domestic
servants
in
Jewish
households
192
The
Reich
Citizenship
Law
stated
that
only
those
of
German
or
related
blood
were
eligible
for
citizenship
193
At
the
same
time
the
Nazis
used
propaganda
to
promulgate
the
concept
of
Rassenschande
race
defilement
to
justify
the
need
for
a
restrictive
law
194
Thus
Jews
and
other
non
Aryans
were
stripped
of
their
German
citizenship
and
the
wording
of
the
law
also
potentially
allowed
the
Nazis
to
deny
citizenship
to
anyone
who
was
not
supportive
enough
of
the
regime
193
A
supplementary
decree
issued
in
November
defined
as
Jewish
anyone

Jewish
grandparents
or

From
2
August
1934
members
of
the
armed
forces
were
required
to
pledge
an
oath
of
unconditional
obedience
to
Hitler
personally
In
contrast
to
the
previous
oath
which
required
allegiance
to
the
constitution
of
the
country
and
its
lawful
establishments
this
new
oath
required
members
of
the
military
to
obey
Hitler
even
if
they
were
being
ordered
to
do
something
illegal
196
Hitler
decreed
that
the
army
would
have
to
tolerate
and
even
offer
logistical
support
to
the
Einsatzgruppen
the
mobile
death
squads
responsible
for
millions
of
deaths
in
Eastern

when
it
was
tactically
possible
to
do

the

also
participated
directly
in
the
Holocaust
by
shooting
civilians
or
undertaking
genocide
under
the
guise
of
anti

operations
198
The
party
line
was
that
the
Jews
were
the
instigators
of
the
partisan
struggle
and
therefore
needed
to
be
eliminated
199
On
8
July
1941
Heydrich
announced
that
all
Jews
were
to
be
regarded
as

spite
of
efforts
to
prepare
the
country
militarily
the
economy
could
not
sustain
a
lengthy
war
of
attrition
such
as
had
occurred
in
World
War
I
A
strategy
was
developed
based
on
the
tactic
of
Blitzkrieg
lightning
war
which
involved
using
quick
coordinated
assaults
that
avoided
enemy
strong
points
Attacks
began
with
artillery
bombardment
followed
by
bombing
and
strafing
runs
Next
the
tanks
would
attack
and
finally
the
infantry
would
move
in
to
secure
any
ground
that
had
been
taken
201
Victories
continued
through
mid
1940
but
the
failure
to
defeat
Britain
was
the
first
major
turning
point
in
the
war
The
decision
to
attack
the
Soviet
Union
and
the
decisive
defeat
at
Stalingrad
led
to
the
retreat
of
the
German
armies
and
the
eventual
loss
of
the
war
202
The
total
number
of
soldiers
who
served
in
the
Wehrmacht
from
1935
to
1945
was
around
18
2
million
of
whom
5

million
died

The
SA
and
SS
The
Sturmabteilung
SA
Storm
Detachment
Brownshirts
founded
in
1921
was
the
first
paramilitary
wing
of
the
Nazi
Party
and
their
initial
assignment
was
to
protect
Nazi
leaders
at
rallies
and
assemblies
203
They
also
took
part
in
street
battles
against
the
forces
of
rival
political
parties
and
violent
actions
against
Jews
and
others
204
By
1934
under
Ernst
R
hm
s
leadership
the
SA
had
grown
to
over
half
a
million
members
4
5
million
including
reserves
at
a
time
when
the
regular
army
was
still
limited
to
100
000
men
by
the
Versailles
Treaty
205
R
hm
hoped
to
assume
command
of
the
army
and
absorb
it
into
the
ranks
of
the
SA
206
Hindenburg
and
Defence
Minister
Werner
von
Blomberg
threatened
to
impose
martial
law
if
the
alarming
activities
of
the
SA
were
not
curtailed
207
Hitler
also
suspected
that
R
hm
was
plotting
to
depose
him
so
he
ordered
the
deaths
of
R
hm
and
other
political
enemies
Up
to
200
people
were
killed
from
30
June
to
2
July
1934
in
an
event
that
became
known
as
the
Night
of
the
Long
Knives
208
After
this
purge
the
SA
was
no
longer
a
major
force

Initially
a
force
of
a
dozen
men
under
the
auspices
of
the
SA
the
Schutzstaffel
SS
grew
to
become
one
of
the
largest
and
most
powerful
groups
in
Nazi
Germany
210
Led
by
Reichsf

SS
Heinrich
Himmler
from
1929
the
SS
had
over
a
quarter
million
members
by
1938
and
continued
to
grow
211
Himmler
envisioned
the
SS
as
being
an
elite
group
of
guards
Hitler
s
last
line
of
defence
212
The
Waffen
SS
the
military
branch
of
the
SS
became
a
de
facto
fourth
branch
of
the
Wehrmacht
213
214
In
1931
Himmler
organised
an
SS
intelligence
service
which
became
known
as
the
Sicherheitsdienst
SD
Security
Service
under
his
deputy
SS
Obergruppenf
hrer
Reinhard
Heydrich
215
This
organisation
was
tasked
with
locating
and
arresting
communists
and
other
political
opponents
Himmler
hoped
it
would
eventually
totally
replace
the
existing
police
system
216
217
Himmler
also
established
the
beginnings
of
a

From
1935
forward
the
SS
was
heavily
involved
in
the
persecution
of
Jews
who
were
rounded
up
into
ghettos
and
concentration
camps
220
With
the
outbreak
of
World
War
II
SS
units
called
Einsatzgruppen
followed
the
army
into
Poland
and
the
Soviet
Union
where
from
1941
to
1945
they
killed
more
than
two
million
people
including

The
most
pressing
economic
matter
the
Nazis
initially
faced
was
the
30
percent
national
unemployment
rate
225
Economist
Dr
Hjalmar
Schacht
President
of
the
Reichsbank
and
Minister
of
Economics
created
in
May
1933
a
scheme
for
deficit
financing
Capital
projects
were
paid
for
with
the
issuance
of
promissory
notes
called
Mefo
bills
When
the
notes
were
presented
for
payment
the
Reichsbank
printed
money
to
do
so
While
the
national
debt
soared
Hitler
and
his
economic
team
expected
that
the
upcoming
territorial
expansion
would
provide
the
means
of
repaying
the
debt
226
Schacht
s
administration
achieved
a
rapid
decline
in
the
unemployment
rate
the
largest
of
any
country
during
the
Great
Depression
225
On
17
October
1933
aviation
pioneer
Hugo
Junkers
owner
of
the
Junkers
Aircraft
Works
was
arrested
and
within
a
few
days
his
company
was
expropriated
by
the
regime
In
concert
with
other
aircraft
manufacturers
and
under
the
direction
of
Aviation
Minister
G
ring
production
was
immediately
ramped
up
industry
wide
From
a
workforce
of
3
200
people
producing
100
units
per
year
in
1932
the
industry
grew
to
employ
a
quarter
of
a
million
workers
manufacturing
over
10
000
technically
advanced
aircraft
per
year
less
than
ten
years
later

IG
Farben
synthetic
oil
plant
under
construction
at
Buna
Werke
1941
this
plant
was
part
of
the
complex
at
Auschwitz
concentration
camp
An
elaborate
bureaucracy
was
created
to
regulate
German
imports
of
raw
materials
and
finished
goods
with
the
intention
of
eliminating
foreign
competition
in
the
German
marketplace
and
improving
the
nation
s
balance
of
payments
The
Nazis
encouraged
the
development
of
synthetic
replacements
for
materials
such
as
oil
and
textiles
228
As
the
market
was
experiencing
a
glut
and
prices
for
petroleum
were
low
in
1933
the
Nazi
government
made
a
profit
sharing
agreement
with
IG
Farben
guaranteeing
them
a
5
percent
return
on
capital
invested
in
their
synthetic
oil
plant
at
Leuna
Any
profits
in
excess
of
that
amount
would
be
turned
over
to
the
Reich
By
1936
Farben
regretted
making
the
deal
as
the
excess
profits
by
then
being
generated
had
to
be
given
to
the
government
229
Major
public
works
projects
financed
with
deficit
spending
included
the
construction
of
a
network
of
Autobahns
and
providing
funding
for
programmes
initiated
by
the
previous
government
for
housing
and
agricultural
improvements
230
To
stimulate
the
construction
industry
credit
was
offered
to
private
businesses
and
subsidies
were
made
available
for
home
purchases
and
repairs
231
On
the
condition
that
the
wife
would
leave
the
workforce
a
loan
of
up
to
1
000
Reichsmarks
could
be
accessed
by
young
couples
of
Aryan
descent
who
intended
to
marry
and
the
amount
that
had
to
be
repaid
was
reduced
by
25
percent
for
each
child
born
232
The
caveat
that
the
woman
had
to
remain
unemployed
was
dropped
by
1937
due
to
a
shortage
of
skilled
labourers
233
Autobahn
late
1930s
Hitler
envisioned
widespread
car
ownership
as
part
of
the
new
Germany
and
he
arranged
for

Ferdinand
Porsche
to
draw
up
plans
for
the

A
prototype
was
displayed
at
the
International
Motor
Show
in
Berlin
on
17
February
1939
With
the
outbreak
of
World
War
II
the
factory
was
converted
to
produce
military
vehicles
No
production
models
were
sold
until
after
the
war
when
the

was
renamed
the
Volkswagen
people
s
car
234
Six
million
people
were
unemployed
when
the
Nazis
took
power
in
1933
and
by
1937
there
were
fewer
than
a
million
235
This
was
in
part
due
to
the
removal
of
women
from
the
workforce
236
Real
wages
dropped
by
25
percent
between
1933
and
1938
225
Trade
unions
were
abolished
in
May
1933
with
the
seizure
of
the
funds
and
arrest
of
the
leadership
of
the
Social
Democratic
trade
unions
A
new
organisation
the
German
Labour
Front
was
created
and
placed
under
NSDAP
functionary
Robert
Ley
237
The
average
German
worked
43
hours
a
week
in
1933
and
by
1939
this
increased
to
47
hours
a
week
238
By
early
1934
the
focus
shifted
away
from
funding
work
creation
schemes
and
toward
rearmament
By
1935
military
expenditures
accounted
for
73
percent
of
the
government
s
purchases
of
goods
and
services
239
On
18
October
1936
Hitler
named
G
ring
as
Plenipotentiary
of
the
Four
Year
Plan
intended
to
speed
up
the
rearmament
programme
240
In
addition
to
calling
for
the
rapid
construction
of
steel
mills
synthetic
rubber
plants
and
other
factories
G
ring
instituted
wage
and
price
controls
and
restricted
the
issuance
of
stock
dividends
225
Large
expenditures
were
made
on
rearmament
in
spite
of
growing
deficits
241
With
the
introduction
of
compulsory
military
service
in
1935
the
Reichswehr
which
had
been
limited
to
100
000
by
the
terms
of
the
Versailles
Treaty
expanded
to
750
000
on
active
service
at
the
start
of
World
War
II
with
a
million
more
in
the
reserve
242
By
January
1939
unemployment
was
down
to
301
800
and
it
dropped
to

The
Nazi
war
economy
was
a
mixed
economy
that
combined
a
free
market
with
central
planning
Historian
Richard
Overy
described
it
as
being
somewhere
in
between
the
command
economy
of
the
Soviet
Union
and
the
capitalist
system
of
the
United
States
244
In
1942
after
the
death
of
Armaments
Minister
Fritz
Todt
Hitler
appointed
Albert
Speer
as
his
replacement
245
Speer
improved
production
via
streamlined
organisation
the
use
of
single
purpose
machines
operated
by
unskilled
workers
rationalisation
of
production
methods
and
better
co
ordination
between
the
many
different
firms
that
made
tens
of
thousands
of
components
Factories
were
relocated
away
from
rail
yards
which
were
bombing
targets
246
247
By
1944
the
war
was
consuming
75
percent
of
Germany
s
gross
domestic
product
compared
to
60
percent
in
the
Soviet
Union
and
55
percent
in
Britain
248
The
wartime
economy
relied
heavily
upon
the
large
scale
employment
of
forced
labourers
Germany
imported
and
enslaved
some
12
million
people
from
20
European
countries
to
work
in
factories
and
on
farms
approximately
75
percent
were
Eastern
European
249
Many
were
casualties
of
Allied
bombing
as
they
received
poor
air
raid
protection
and
poor
living
conditions
led
to
high
rates
of
sickness
injury
and
death
as
well
as
sabotage
and
criminal
activity
250
The
wartime
economy
also
relied
upon
large
scale
robbery
initially
through
the
state
seizing
the
property
of
Jewish
citizens
and
later
by
also
plundering
the
resources
of
occupied
territories
251
Foreign
workers
brought
into
Germany
were
put
into
four
different
classifications
guest
workers
military
internees
civilian
workers
and
Eastern
workers
Different
regulations
were
placed
upon
the
worker
depending
on
their
classification
To
separate
Germans
and
foreign
workers
the
Nazis
issued
a
ban
on
sexual
relations
between
Germans
and
foreign
workers
252
253
Women
played
an
increasingly
large
role
and
by
1944
over
a
half
million
served
as
auxiliaries
in
the
German
armed
forces
especially
in
anti
aircraft
units
of
the
Luftwaffe
a
half
million
worked
in
civil
aerial
defence
and
400
000
were
volunteer
nurses
They
also
replaced
men
in
the
wartime
economy
especially
on
farms
and
in
small
family
owned
shops
254
Very
heavy
strategic
bombing
by
the
Allies
targeted
refineries
producing
synthetic
oil
and
gasoline
as
well
as
the
German
transportation
system
especially
rail
yards
and
canals
255
The
armaments
industry
began
to
break
down
by
September
1944
By
November
fuel
coal
was
no
longer
reaching
its
destinations
and
the
production
of
new
armaments
was
no
longer
possible
256
Overy
argues
that
the
bombing
strained
the
German
war
economy
and
forced
it
to
divert
up
to
one
fourth
of
its
manpower
and
industry
into
anti
aircraft
resources
which
very
likely
shortened
the
war
257
Racial
policy
Main

Nazism
and
race
and
Racial
policy
of
Nazi
Germany
Racism
and
antisemitism
were
basic
tenets
of
the
NSDAP
and
the
Nazi
regime
Nazi
Germany
s
racial
policy
was
based
on
their
belief
in
the
existence
of
a
superior
master
race
The
Nazis
postulated
the
existence
of
a
racial
conflict
between
the
Aryan
master
race
and
inferior
races
particularly
Jews
who
were
viewed
as
a
mixed
race
that
had
infiltrated
society
and
were
responsible
for
the
exploitation
and
repression
of
the
Aryan
race
258
Persecution
of
Jews
Further
information
Anti
Jewish
legislation
in
prewar
Nazi
Germany
Discrimination
against
Jews
began
immediately
after
the
seizure
of
power
and
following
a
month
long
series
of
attacks
by
members
of
the
SA
on
Jewish
businesses
synagogues
and
members
of
the
legal
profession
on
1
April
1933
Hitler
declared
a
national
boycott
of
Jewish
businesses
259
The
Law
for
the
Restoration
of
the
Professional
Civil
Service
passed
on
7
April
and
forced
all
non
Aryan
civil
servants
to
retire
from
the
legal
profession
and
civil
service
260
Similar
legislation
soon
deprived
Jewish
members
of
other
professions
of
their
right
to
practise
and
on
11
April
a
decree
was
promulgated
that
stated
anyone
who
had
even
one
Jewish
parent
or
grandparent
was
considered
non
Aryan
261
As
part
of
the
drive
to
remove
Jewish
influence
from
cultural
life
members
of
the
National
Socialist
Student
League
removed
from
libraries
any
books
considered
un
German
and
a
nationwide
book
burning
was
held
on
10
May
262
Violence
and
economic
pressure
were
used
by
the
regime
to
encourage
Jews
to
voluntarily
leave
the
country
263
Jewish
businesses
were
denied
access
to
markets
forbidden
to
advertise
in
newspapers
and
deprived
of
access
to
government
contracts
Citizens
were
harassed
and
subjected
to
violent
attacks
264
Many
towns
posted
signs
forbidding
entry
to
Jews

Damage
caused
during
Kristallnacht
9
November
1938
In
November
1938
a
young
Jewish
man
requested
an
interview
with
the
German
ambassador
in
Paris
and
met
with
a
legation
secretary
whom
he
shot
and
killed
to
protest
his
family
s
treatment
in
Germany
This
incident
provided
the
pretext
for
a
pogrom
the
NSDAP
incited
against
the
Jews
on
9
November
1938
Members
of
the
SA
damaged
or
destroyed
synagogues
and
Jewish
property
throughout
Germany
At
least
91
German
Jews
were
killed
during
this
pogrom
later
called
Kristallnacht
the
Night
of
Broken
Glass
266
267
Further
restrictions
were
imposed
on
Jews
in
the
coming
months
they
were
forbidden
to
own
businesses
or
work
in
retail
shops
drive
cars
go
to
the
cinema
visit
the
library
or
own
weapons
and
Jewish
pupils
were
removed
from
schools
The
Jewish
community
was
fined
one
billion
marks
to
pay
for
the
damage
caused
by
Kristallnacht
and
told
that
any
money
received
via
insurance
claims
would
be
confiscated
268
By
1939
around
250
000
of
Germany
s
437
000
Jews
emigrated
to
the
United
States
Argentina
Great
Britain
Palestine
and
other
countries
269
270
Many
chose
to
stay
in
continental

Emigrants
to
Palestine
were
allowed
to
transfer
property
there
under
the
terms
of
the
Haavara
Agreement
but
those
moving
to
other

had
to
leave

Action
T4
was
a
programme
of
systematic
murder
of
the
physically
and
mentally
handicapped
and
patients
in
psychiatric
hospitals
that
mainly
took
place
from
1939
to
1941
and
continued
until
the
end
of
the
war
Initially
the
victims
were
shot
by
the
Einsatzgruppen
and
others
in
addition
gas
chambers
and
gas
vans
using
carbon

were
used
by

Under
the
provisions
of
a
law
promulgated
14
July
1933
the
Nazi
regime
carried
out
the
compulsory
sterilisation
of
over
400
000
individuals
labelled
as
having
hereditary
defects
273
More
than
half
the
people
sterilised
were
those
considered
mentally
deficient
which
included
not
only
people
who
scored
poorly
on
intelligence
tests
but
those
who
deviated
from
expected
standards
of
behaviour
regarding
thrift
sexual
behaviour
and

Mentally

were
also
targeted
The

of
the
victims
came
from
disadvantaged
groups
such
as
prostitutes
the
poor
the

and
criminals
274
Other

The

Main

The
Holocaust
Crematorium
at
Auschwitz
I
Germany
s
war
in
the
East
was
based
on
Hitler
s
long
standing
view
that
Jews
were
the
great
enemy
of
the
German
people
and
that
Lebensraum
was
needed
for
Germany
s
expansion
Hitler
focused
his
attention
on
Eastern
Europe
aiming
to
defeat
Poland
the
Soviet
Union
and
remove
or
kill
the
resident
Jews
and
Slavs
in
the
process
157
158
After
the
occupation
of
Poland
all
Jews
living
in
the
General
Government
were
confined
to
ghettos
and
those
who
were
physically
fit
were
required
to
perform
compulsory
labour
276
In
1941
Hitler
decided
to
destroy
the
Polish
nation
completely
and
planned
that
within
10
to
20
years
the
section
of
Poland
under
German
occupation
would
be
cleared
of
ethnic
Poles
and
resettled
by
German
colonists
277
About
3
8
to
4
million
Poles
would
remain
as
slaves
278
part
of
a
slave
labour
force
of
14
million
the
Nazis
intended
to
create
using
citizens
of
conquered
nations
in
the
East
158
279
The
Generalplan
Ost
General
Plan
for
the
East
called
for
deporting
the
population
of
occupied
Eastern
Europe
and
the
Soviet
Union
to
Siberia
for
use
as
slave
labour
or
to
be
murdered
280
To
determine
who
should
be
killed
Himmler
created
the
Volksliste
a
system
of
classification
of
people
deemed
to
be
of
German
blood
281
He
ordered
that
those
of
Germanic
descent
who
refused
to
be
classified
as
ethnic
Germans
should
be
deported
to
concentration
camps
have
their
children
taken
away
or
be
assigned
to
forced
labour
282
283
The
plan
also
included
the
kidnapping
of
children
deemed
to
have
Aryan
Nordic
traits
who
were
presumed
to
be
of
German
descent
284
The
goal
was
to
implement
Generalplan
Ost
after
the
conquest
of
the
Soviet
Union
but
when
the
invasion
failed
Hitler
had
to
consider
other
options
280
285
One
suggestion
was
a
mass
forced
deportation
of
Jews
to
Poland
Palestine
or
Madagascar

Somewhere
around
the
time
of
the
failed
offensive
against
Moscow
in
December
1941
Hitler
resolved
that
the
Jews
of
Europe
were
to
be
exterminated
immediately
286
Plans
for
the
total
eradication
of
the
Jewish
population
of
Europe
eleven
million
people
were
formalised
at
the
Wannsee
Conference
on
20
January
1942
Some
would
be
worked
to
death
and
the
rest
would
be
killed
in
the
implementation
of
Die
Endl
sung
der
Judenfrage
the
Final
Solution
of
the
Jewish
question
287
Initially
the
victims
were
killed
with
gas
vans
or
by
Einsatzgruppen
firing
squads
but
these
methods
proved
impracticable
for
an
operation
of
this
scale
288
By
1941
killing
centres
at
Auschwitz
concentration
camp
Sobibor
Treblinka
and
other
Nazi
extermination
camps
replaced
Einsatzgruppen
as
the
primary
method
of
mass
killing
289
The
total
number
of
Jews
murdered
during
the
war
is
estimated
at
5
5
to
six
million
people
224
including
over
a
million
children
290
Twelve
million
people
were
put
into
forced
labour
249
German
citizens
despite
much
of
the
later
denial
had
access
to
information
about
what
was
happening
as
soldiers
returning
from
the
occupied
territories
would
report
on
what
they
had
seen
and
done
291
Evans
states
that
most
German
citizens
disapproved
of
the
genocide
292
h
Some
Polish
citizens
tried
to
rescue
or
hide
the
remaining
Jews
and
members
of
the
Polish
underground
got
word
to
their
government
in
exile
in
London
as
to
what
was
happening
293
In
addition
to
eliminating
Jews
the
Nazis
also
planned
to
reduce
the
population
of
the
conquered
territories
by
30
million
people
through
starvation
in
an
action
called
the
Hunger
Plan
Food
supplies
would
be
diverted
to
the
German
army
and
German
civilians
Cities
would
be
razed
and
the
land
allowed
to
return
to
forest
or
resettled
by
German
colonists
294
Together
the
Hunger
Plan
and
Generalplan
Ost
would
have
led
to
the
starvation
of
80
million
people
in
the
Soviet
Union
295
These
partially
fulfilled
plans
resulted
in
the
democidal
deaths
of

Role
of
women
and
family
Further
information
Women
in
Nazi
Germany
Women
were
a
cornerstone
of
Nazi
social
policy
and
the
Nazis
opposed
the
feminist
movement
claiming
that
it
was
the
creation
of
Jewish
intellectuals
instead
advocating
a
patriarchal
society
in
which
the
German
woman
would
recognise
that
her
world
is
her
husband
her
family
her
children
and
her
home
236
Soon
after
the
seizure
of
power
feminist
groups
were
shut
down
or
incorporated
into
the
National
Socialist
Women
s
League
which
coordinated
groups
throughout
the
country
to
promote
motherhood
and
household
activities
Courses
were
offered
on
childrearing
sewing
and
cooking
362
The
League
published
the
NS
Frauen
Warte
the
only
NSDAP
approved
women
s
magazine
in
Nazi
Germany
363
Despite
some
propaganda
aspects
it
was
predominantly
an
ordinary
woman
s
magazine
364
Women
were
encouraged
to
leave
the
workforce
and
the
creation
of
large
families
by
racially
suitable
women
was
promoted
through
a
propaganda
campaign
Women
received
a
bronze
award
known
as
the
Ehrenkreuz
der
Deutschen
Mutter
Cross
of
Honour
of
the
German
Mother
for
giving
birth
to
four
children
silver
for
six
and
gold
for
eight
or
more
362
Large
families
received
subsidies
to
help
with
their
utilities
school
fees
and
household
expenses
Though
the
measures
led
to
increases
in
the
birth
rate
the
number
of
families
having
four
or
more
children
declined
by
five
percent
between
1935
and
1940
365
Removing
women
from
the
workforce
did
not
have
the
intended
effect
of
freeing
up
jobs
for
men
as
women
were
for
the
most
part
employed
as
domestic
servants
weavers
or
in
the
food
and
drink
industries
jobs
that
were
not
of
interest
to
men
366
Nazi
philosophy
prevented
large
numbers
of
women
from
being
hired
to
work
in
munitions
factories
in
the
build
up
to
the
war
so
foreign
labourers
were
brought
in
After
the
war
started
slave
labourers
were
extensively
used
367
In
January
1943
Hitler
signed
a
decree
requiring
all
women
under
the
age
of
fifty
to
report
for
work
assignments
to
help
the
war
effort
368
Thereafter
women
were
funnelled
into
agricultural
and
industrial
jobs
and
by
September
1944
14
9
million
women
were
working
in
munitions
production

in
1941
The
Nazi
regime
discouraged
women
from
seeking
higher
education
since
Nazi
leaders
held
conservative
views
about
women
and
endorsed
the
idea
that
rational
and
theoretical
work
was
alien
to
a
woman
s
nature
since
they
were
considered
inherently
emotional
and
instinctive
as
such
engaging
in
academics
and
careerism
would
only
divert
them
from
motherhood
370
The
number
of
women
allowed
to
enroll
in
universities
dropped
drastically
as
a
law
passed
in
April
1933
limited
the
number
of
females
admitted
to
university
to
ten
percent
of
the
number
of
male
attendees
371
Female
enrolment
in
secondary
schools
dropped
from
437
000
in
1926
to
205
000
in
1937
The
number
of
women
enrolled
in
post
secondary
schools
dropped
from
128
000
in
1933
to
51
000
in
1938
However
with
the
requirement
that
men
be
enlisted
into
the
armed
forces
during
the
war
women
comprised
half
of
the
enrolment
in
the
post
secondary
system
by
1944
372
Women
were
expected
to
be
strong
healthy
and
vital
373
The
sturdy
peasant
woman
who
worked
the
land
and
bore
strong
children
was
considered
ideal
and
athletic
women
were
praised
for
being
tanned
from
working
outdoors
374
Organisations
were
created
for
the
indoctrination
of
Nazi
values
and
from
25
March
1939
membership
in
the
Hitler
Youth
became
compulsory
for
all
children
over
the
age
of
ten
375
The
Jungm
delbund
Young
Girls
League
section
of
the
Hitler
Youth
was
for
girls
age
10
to
14
and
the
Bund
Deutscher
M
del
BDM
League
of
German
Girls
was
for
young
women
age
14
to
18
The
BDM
s
activities
focused
on
physical
education
with
activities
such
as
running
long
jumping
somersaulting
tightrope
walking
marching
and
swimming
376
The
Nazi
regime
promoted
a
liberal
code
of
conduct
regarding
sexual
matters
and
was
sympathetic
to
women
who
bore
children
out
of
wedlock
377
Promiscuity
increased
as
the
war
progressed
with
unmarried
soldiers
often
intimately
involved
with
several
women
simultaneously
The
same
was
the
case
for
married
women
who
liaised
with
soldiers
civilians
or
slave
labourers
For
example
sex
was
sometimes
used
as
a
commodity
to
obtain
better
work
from
a
foreign
labourer
377
Pamphlets
enjoined
German
women
to
avoid
sexual
relations
with
foreign
workers
as
a
danger
to
their
blood
378
With
Hitler
s
approval
Himmler
intended
that
the
new
society
of
the
Nazi
regime
should
destigmatise
illegitimate
births
particularly
of
children
fathered
by
members
of
the
SS
who
were
vetted
for
racial
purity
379
His
hope
was
that
each
SS
family
would
have
between
four
and
six
children
379
The
Lebensborn
Fountain
of
Life
association
founded
by
Himmler
in
1935
created
a
series
of
maternity
homes
where
single
mothers
could
be
accommodated
during
their
pregnancies
380
Both
parents
were
examined
for
racial
suitability
before
acceptance
380
The
resulting
children
were
often
adopted
into
SS
families
380
The
homes
were
also
made
available
to
the
wives
of
SS
and
NSDAP
members
who
quickly
filled
over
half
the
available
spots
381
Existing
laws
banning
abortion
except
for
medical
reasons
were
strictly
enforced
by
the
Nazi
regime
The
number
of
abortions
declined
from
35
000
per
year
at
the
start
of
the
1930s
to
fewer
than
2
000
per
year
at
the
end
of
the
decade
though
in
1935
a
law
was
passed
allowing
abortions
for
eugenics
reasons
382
Environmentalism

Animal
welfare
in
Nazi
Germany
Nazi
society
had
elements
supportive
of
animal
rights
and
many
people
were
fond
of
zoos
and
wildlife
383
The
government
took
several
measures
to
ensure
the
protection
of
animals
and
the
environment
In
1933
the
Nazis
enacted
a
stringent
animal
protection
law
that
affected
what
was
allowed
for
medical
research
384
However
the
law
was
only
loosely
enforced
and
in
spite
of
a
ban
on
vivisection
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
readily
handed
out
permits
for
experiments
on
animals
385
The

Forestry
Office
under
G

enforced
regulations
that
required
foresters
to
plant
a
wide
variety
of
trees
to
ensure
suitable
habitat
for

and
a
new
Reich
Animal
Protection
Act
became
law
in
1933
386
The
regime
enacted
the
Reich
Nature
Protection
Act
in
1935
to
protect
the
natural
landscape
from
excessive
economic
development
and
it
allowed
for
the
expropriation
of
privately
owned
land
to
create
nature
preserves
and
aided
in
long

387
Perfunctory
efforts
were
made
to
curb
air
pollution
but
little
enforcement
of
existing
legislation
was
undertaken
once
the
war
began
388
Culture
The
regime
promoted
the
concept
of
Volksgemeinschaft

national
German
ethnic
community
The
goal
was
to
build
a

based
on
racial
purity
and
the
perceived

conquest
and
a

State
Secretary
in
the
Federal
Ministry
of

Interior
Christoph
Bergner
said
the
reason
the

do
not

is
because
Haar

killed
The

suggests
that

ordinary

not
approve

out
in
the

The
party
emerged
from
the
German
nationalist
racist
and
populist
Freikorps
paramilitary
culture
which
fought
against
the
communist
uprisings
in
post
World
War
I
Germany
6
The
party
was
created
as
a
means
to
draw
workers
away
from
communism
and
into
v
lkisch
nationalism
7
Initially
Nazi
political
strategy
focused
on
anti
big
business
anti
bourgeois
and
anti
capitalist
rhetoric
although
such
aspects
were
later
downplayed
in
order
to
gain
the
support
of
industrial
entities
and
in
the
1930s
the
party
s
focus
shifted
to
anti
Semitic
and
anti
Marxist
themes
8
Pseudo
scientific
racism
theories
were
central
to
Nazism
The
Nazis
propagated
the
idea
of
a
people
s
community
Volksgemeinschaft
Their
aim
was
to
unite
racially
desirable
Germans
as
national
comrades
while
excluding
those
deemed
either
to
be
political
dissidents
physically
or
intellectually
inferior
or
of
a
foreign
race
Fremdv
lkische
9
The
Nazis
sought
to
improve
the
stock
of
the
Germanic
people
through
racial
purity
and
eugenics
broad
social
welfare
programs
and
a
collective
subordination
of
individual
rights
which
could
be
sacrificed
for
the
good
of
the
state
and
the
Aryan
master
race
To
maintain
the
supposed
purity
and
strength
of
the
Aryan
race
the
Nazis
sought
to
exterminate
Jews
Romani
and
Poles
along
with
the
vast

Etymology
The
term
Nazi
derives
from
the
name
given
in
German
to
a
party
member
Nationalsozialist
German
pronunciation
natsi
o
na
lzotsi
a
l
st
and
was
coined
in
response
to
the
German
term
Sozi
pronounced
zo
tsi
an
abbreviation
of
Sozialdemokrat
member
of
the
Social
Democratic
Party
of
Germany
16
17
Members
of
the
party
referred
to
themselves
as
Nationalsozialisten
National
Socialists
rarely
as
Nazis
The
term
Parteigenosse
party
member
was
commonly
used
among
Nazis
with
the
feminine
form
Parteigenossin
used
when
it
was
appropriate
18
The
term
was
in
use
before
the
rise
of
the
party
as
a
colloquial
and
derogatory
word
for
a
backward
peasant
characterising
an
awkward
and
clumsy
person
It
derived
from
Ignaz
being
a
shortened
version
of
Ignatius
19
20
a
common
name
in
Bavaria
the
area
from
which
the
Nazis
emerged
Opponents
seized
on
this
and
shortened
the
party
s
name
in
intentional
association
to
the
long
time
existing
Sozi
to
the
dismissive
Nazi
20
21
In
1933
when
Adolf
Hitler
assumed
power
of
the
German
government
usage
of
the
designation
Nazi
diminished
in
Germany
although
Austrian
anti
Nazis
continued
to
use
the
term
derogatorily
17
The
use
of
Nazi
Germany
and
Nazi
regime
was
popularised
by
anti
Nazis
and
German
exiles
abroad
Thereafter
the
term
spread
into
other
languages
and
eventually
was
brought
back
to
Germany
after
the
Second
World
War
21
History
Origins
and
early
existence
1918
1923
The
party
grew
out
of
smaller
political
groups
with
a
nationalist
orientation
that
formed
in
the
last
years
of
World
War
I
In
1918
a
league
called
the
Freien
Arbeiterausschuss
f
r
einen
guten
Frieden
Free
Workers
Committee
for
a
good
Peace
22
was
created
in
Bremen
Germany
On
7
March
1918
Anton
Drexler
an
avid
German
nationalist
formed
a
branch
of
this
league
in
Munich
22
Drexler
was
a
local
locksmith
who
had
been
a
member
of
the
militarist
Fatherland
Party
23
during
World
War
I
and
was
bitterly
opposed
to
the
armistice
of
November
1918
and
the
revolutionary
upheavals
that
followed
Drexler
followed
the
views
of
militant
nationalists
of
the
day
such
as
opposing
the
Treaty
of
Versailles
having
antisemitic
anti
monarchist
and
anti
Marxist
views
as
well
as
believing
in
the
superiority
of
Germans
whom
they
claimed
to
be
part
of
the
Aryan
master
race
Herrenvolk
However
he
also
accused
international
capitalism
of
being
a
Jewish
dominated
movement
and
denounced
capitalists
for
war
profiteering
in
World
War
I
24
Drexler
saw
the
political
violence
and
instability
in
Germany
the
result
of
the
Weimar
Republic
being
out
of
touch
with
the
masses
especially
the
lower
classes
24
Drexler
emphasized
the
need
for
a
synthesis
of
v
lkisch
nationalism
with
a
form
of
economic
socialism
in
order
to
create
a
popular
nationalist
oriented
workers
movement
that
could
challenge
the
rise
of
Communism
and
internationalist
politics
25
These
were
all
well
known
themes
popular
with
various
Weimar
paramilitary
groups
such
as
the
Freikorps
Nazi
Party
badge
emblem
Drexler
s
movement
did
receive
attention
and
support
from
some
influential
figures
Supporter
Dietrich
Eckhart
brought
military
figure
Count
Felix
Graf
von
Bothmer
a
prominent
supporter
of
the
concept
of
national
socialism
to
address
the
movement
26
Later
in
1918
Karl
Harrer
a
journalist
and
member
of
the
Thule
Society
convinced
Drexler
and
several
others
to
form
the
Politischer
Arbeiterzirkel
Political
Workers
Circle
22
The
members
met
periodically
for
discussions
with
themes
of
nationalism
and
racism
directed
against
the
Jews
22
In
December
1918
Drexler
decided
that
a
new
political
party
should
be
formed
based
on
the
political
principles
that
he
endorsed
by
combining
his
branch
of
the
Workers
Committee
for
a
good
Peace
with
the
Political
Workers
Circle
22
27
On
5
January
1919
Drexler
created
a
new
political
party
and
proposed
it
be
named
the
German
Socialist
Workers
Party
but
Harrer
objected
to
the
term
socialist
so
the
term
was
removed
and
the
party
was
named
the
German
Workers
Party
Deutsche
Arbeiterpartei
DAP
28
To
ease
concerns
among
potential
middle
class
supporters
Drexler
made
clear
that
unlike
Marxists
the
party
supported
the
middle
class
and
that
its
socialist
policy
was
meant
to
give
social
welfare
to
German
citizens
deemed
part
of
the
Aryan
race
24
They
became
one
of
many
v
lkisch
movements
that
existed
in
Germany
Like
other
v
lkisch
groups
the
DAP
advocated
the
belief
that
through
profit
sharing
instead
of
socialisation
Germany
should
become
a
unified
people
s
community
Volksgemeinschaft
rather
than
a
society
divided
along
class
and
party
lines
29
This
ideology
was
explicitly
antisemitic
As
early
as
1920
the
party
was
raising
money
by
selling
a
tobacco
called
Anti
Semit

NSDAP
membership
book
From
the
outset
the
DAP
was
opposed
to
non
nationalist
political
movements
especially
on
the
left
including
the
Social
Democratic
Party
of
Germany
SPD
and
the
Communist
Party
of
Germany
KPD
Members
of
the
DAP
saw
themselves
as
fighting
against
Bolshevism
and
anyone
considered
a
part
of
or
aiding
so
called
international
Jewry
The
DAP
was
also
deeply
opposed
to
the
Versailles
Treaty
31
The
DAP
did
not
attempt
to
make
itself
public
and
meetings
were
kept
in
relative
secrecy
with
public
speakers
discussing
what
they
thought
of
Germany
s
present
state
of
affairs
or
writing
to
like
minded
societies
in
Northern
Germany
29
The
DAP
was
a
comparatively
small
group
with
fewer
than
60
members
29
Nevertheless
it
attracted
the
attention
of
the
German
authorities
who
were
suspicious
of
any
organisation
that
appeared
to
have
subversive
tendencies
In
July
1919
while
stationed
in
Munich
army
Gefreiter
Adolf
Hitler
was
appointed
a
Verbindungsmann
intelligence
agent
of
an
Aufkl
rungskommando
reconnaissance
unit
of
the
Reichswehr
army
by
Captain
Mayr
the
head
of
the
Education
and
Propaganda
Department
Dept
Ib
P
in
Bavaria
Hitler
was
assigned
to
influence
other
soldiers
and
to
infiltrate
the
DAP
32
While
attending
a
party
meeting
on
12
September
1919
Hitler
became
involved
in
a
heated
argument
with
a
visitor
Professor
Baumann
who
questioned
the
soundness
of
Gottfried
Feder
s
arguments
against
capitalism
and
proposed
that
Bavaria
should
break
away
from
Prussia
and
found
a
new
South
German
nation
with
Austria
In
vehemently
attacking
the
man
s
arguments
he
made
an
impression
on
the
other
party
members
with
his
oratory
skills
and
according
to
Hitler
the
professor
left
the
hall
acknowledging
unequivocal
defeat
33
Drexler
encouraged
him
to
join
the
DAP
33
On
the
orders
of
his
army
superiors
Hitler
applied
to
join
the
party
34
and
within
a
week
was
accepted
as
party
member
555
the
party
began
counting
membership
at
500
to
give
the
impression
they
were
a
much
larger
party
35
36
Among
the
party
s
earlier
members
were
Ernst
R
hm
of
the
Army
s
District
Command
VII
well
to

journalist
Dietrich
Eckart
who
has
been
called
the

of
National
Socialism
37
then

student
Rudolf

38
Freikorps
soldier
Hans

and
Alfred

were

regime

later
claimed
to
be
the

member
he
was
in
fact

of
the
party
s
central
committee
40
and
he
would

Anton
Drexler
drafted
a
letter
to
Hitler
in

which
was
never
sent
that
contradicts
Hitler
s
later
claim
No
one
knows
better
than
you
yourself
my
F
hrer
that
you
were
never
the
seventh
member
of
the
party
but
at
best
the
seventh
member
of
the
committee
And
a
few
years
ago
I
had
to
complain
to
a
party
office
that
your
first
proper
membership
card
of
the
DAP
bearing
the
signatures
of
Sch
ssler
and
myself
was
falsified
with
the
number
555
being
erased
and
number

entered
41
Hitler
s
first
DAP
speech
was
held
in
the
Hofbr
ukeller
on
16
October
1919
He
was
the
second
speaker
of
the
evening
and
spoke
to
111
people
42
Hitler
later
declared
that
this
was
when
he
realised
he
could
really
make
a
good
speech
29
At
first
Hitler
spoke
only
to
relatively
small
groups
but
his
considerable
oratory
and
propaganda
skills
were
appreciated
by
the
party
leadership
With
the
support
of
Anton
Drexler
Hitler
became
chief
of
propaganda
for
the
party
in
early
1920
43
Hitler
began
to
make
the
party
more
public
and
organised
their
biggest
meeting
yet
of
2
000
people
on
24
February
1920
in
the
Staatliches
Hofbr
uhaus
in
M
nchen
Such
was
the
significance
of
this
particular
move
in
publicity
that
Harrer
resigned
from
the
party
in
disagreement
44
It
was
in
this
speech
that
Hitler
enunciated
the
twenty
five
points
of
the
German
Workers
Party
manifesto
that
had
been
drawn
up
by
Drexler
Feder
and
Hitler
45
Through
these
points
he
gave
the
organisation
a
much
bolder
stratagem
43
with
a
clear
foreign
policy
abrogation
of
The
Treaty
of
Versailles
a
Greater
Germany
Eastern
expansion
and
exclusion
of
Jews
from
citizenship
and
among
his
specific
points
were
confiscation
of
war
profits
abolition
of
unearned
incomes
the
State
to
share
profits
of
land
and
land
for
national
needs
to
be
taken
away
without
compensation
46
In
general
the
manifesto
was
antisemitic
anti
capitalist
anti
democratic
anti
Marxist
and
anti
liberal
47
To
increase
its
appeal
to
larger
segments
of
the
population
the
same
day
as
Hitler
s
Hofbr
uhaus
speech
on
24
February
1920
the
DAP
changed
its
name
to
the
Nationalsozialistische
Deutsche
Arbeiterpartei
National
Socialist
German
Workers
Party
or
Nazi
Party
48
49
The
word
Socialist
was
added
by
the
party
s
executive
committee
over
Hitler
s
objections
in
order
to
help
appeal
to
left
wing
workers
50
In
1920
the
Nazi
Party
officially
announced
that
only
persons
of
pure
Aryan
descent
rein
arischer
Abkunft
could
become
party
members
and
if
the
person
had
a
spouse
the
spouse
also
had
to
be
a
racially
pure
Aryan
Party
members
could
not
be
related
either
directly
or
indirectly
to
a
so
called
non
Aryan
51
Even
before
it
had
become
legally
forbidden
by
the
Nuremberg
Laws
in
1935
the
Nazis
banned
sexual
relations
and
marriages
between
party
members
and
Jews
52
Party
members
found
guilty
of
Rassenschande
racial
defilement
were
persecuted
heavily
some
members
were
even
sentenced
to
death
53
Hitler
quickly
became
the
party
s
most
active
orator
Appearing
in
public
as
a
speaker
thirty
one
times
within
the
first
year
after
his
self
discovery
54
crowds
began
to
flock
to
hear
his
speeches
55
Hitler
always
spoke
about
the
same
subjects
the
Treaty
of
Versailles
and
the
Jewish
question
47
This
deliberate
technique
and
effective
publicising
of
the
party
contributed
significantly
to
his
early
success
47
about
which
a
contemporary
poster
wrote
Since
Herr
Hitler
is
a
brilliant
speaker
we
can
hold
out
the
prospect
of
an
extremely
exciting
evening
56
Over
the
following
months
the
party
continued
to
attract
new
members
40
while
remaining
too
small
to
have
any
real
significance
in
German
politics
57
By
the
end
of
the
year
party
membership
was
recorded
at
2
000
55
many
of
whom
Hitler
and
R
hm
had
brought
into
the
party
personally
or
for
whom
Hitler
s
oratory
had
been
their
reason
for
joining
58
Hitler
s
talent
as
an
orator
and
his
ability
to
draw
new
members
combined
with
his
characteristic
ruthlessness
soon
made
him
the
dominant
figure
However
while
Hitler
and
Eckart
were
on
a
fundraising
trip
to
Berlin
in
June
1921
a
mutiny
broke
out
within
the
party
in
Munich
Members
of
its
executive
committee
wanted
to
merge
with
the
rival
German
Socialist
Party
DSP
59
Upon
returning
to
Munich
on
11
July
Hitler
angrily
tendered
his
resignation
The
committee
members
realised
that
his
resignation
would
mean
the
end
of
the
party
60
Hitler
announced
he
would
rejoin
on
the
condition
that
he
would
replace
Drexler
as
party
chairman
and
that
the
party
headquarters
would
remain
in
Munich
61
The
committee
agreed
and
he
rejoined
the
party
on
26
July
as
member
3
680
Hitler
continued
to
face
some
opposition
within
the
NSDAP
as
his
opponents
had
Hermann
Esser
expelled
from
the
party
and
they
printed
3
000
copies
of
a
pamphlet
attacking
Hitler
as
a
traitor
to
the
party
61
In
the
following
days
Hitler
spoke
to
several
packed
houses
and
defended
himself
and
Esser
to
thunderous
applause
62
His
strategy
proved
successful
and
at
a
special
party
congress
on
29
July
1921
he
replaced
Drexler
as
party
chairman
by
a
vote
of
533
to
1
62
The
committee
was
dissolved
and
Hitler
was
granted
nearly
absolute
powers
as
the
party
s
sole
leader
62
This
was
a
post
he
would
hold
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
Hitler
soon
acquired
the
title
F
hrer
leader
and
after
a
series
of
sharp
internal
conflicts
it
was
accepted
that
the
party
would
be
governed
by
the
F
hrerprinzip
leader
principle
Under
this
principle
the
party
was
a
highly
centralized
entity
that
functioned
strictly
from
the
top
down
with
Hitler
at
the
apex
as
the
party
s
absolute
leader
Hitler
saw
the
party
as
a
revolutionary
organization
whose
aim
was
the
overthrow
of
the
Weimar
Republic
which
he
saw
as
controlled
by
the
socialists
Jews
and
the
November
criminals
who
had
betrayed
the
German
soldiers
in
1918
The
SA
storm
troopers
also
known
as
Brownshirts
were
founded
as
a
party
militia
in
1921
and
began
violent
attacks
on
other
parties

twin
goals
of
the
party
were
always
German
nationalist
expansionism
and
antisemitism
These
two
goals
were
fused
in
his
mind
by
his
belief
that
Germany
s
external
enemies
Britain
France
and
the
Soviet
Union
were
controlled
by
the
Jews
and
that
Germany
s
future
wars
of
national
expansion
would
necessarily
entail
a
war
against
the
Jews
63
For
Hitler
and
his
principal
lieutenants
national
and
racial
issues
were
always
dominant
This
was
symbolised
by
the
adoption
as
the
party
emblem
of
the
swastika
or
Hakenkreuz
In
German
nationalist
circles
the
swastika
was
considered
a
symbol
of
an
Aryan
race
and
it
symbolized
the
replacement
of
the
Christian
Cross
with
allegiance
to
a
National
Socialist
State
During
1921
and
1922
the
Nazi
Party
grew
significantly
partly
through
Hitler
s
oratorical
skills
partly
through
the
SA
s
appeal
to
unemployed
young
men
and
partly
because
there
was
a
backlash
against
socialist
and
liberal
politics
in
Bavaria
as
Germany
s
economic
problems
deepened
and
the
weakness
of
the
Weimar
regime
became
apparent
The
party
recruited
former
World
War
I
soldiers
to
whom
Hitler
as
a
decorated
frontline
veteran
could
particularly
appeal
as
well
as
small
businessmen
and
disaffected
former
members
of
rival
parties
Nazi
rallies
were
often
held
in
beer
halls
where
downtrodden
men
could
get
free
beer
The
Hitler
Youth
was
formed
for
the
children
of
party
members
The
party
also
formed
groups
in
other
parts
of
Germany
Julius
Streicher
in
Nuremberg
was
an
early
recruit
and
became
editor
of
the
racist
magazine
Der
St
rmer
In
December
1920
the
Nazi
Party
had
acquired
a
newspaper
the
V
lkischer
Beobachter
of
which
its
leading
ideologist
Alfred
Rosenberg
became
editor
Others
to
join
the
party
around
this
time
were
World
War
I
flying
ace
Hermann
G
ring
and
Heinrich
Himmler
On
31
October
1922
a
party
with
similar
policies
and
objectives
came
into
power
in
Italy
the
National
Fascist
Party
under
the
leadership
of
the
charismatic
Benito
Mussolini
The
Fascists
like
the
Nazis
promoted
a
national
rebirth
of
their
country
as
they
opposed
communism
and
liberalism
appealed
to
the
working
class
opposed
the
Treaty
of
Versailles
and
advocated
the
territorial
expansion
of
their
country
The
Italian
Fascists
used
a
straight
armed
Roman
salute
and
wore
black
shirted
uniforms
Hitler
was
inspired
by
Mussolini
and
the
Fascists
borrowing
their
use
of
the
straight
armed
salute
as
a
Nazi
salute
When
the
Fascists
came
to
power
in
1922
in
Italy
through
their
coup
attempt
called
the
March
on
Rome
Hitler
began
planning
his
own
coup
In
January
1923
France
occupied
the
Ruhr
industrial
region
as
a
result
of
Germany
s
failure
to
meet
its
reparations
payments
This
led
to
economic
chaos
the
resignation
of
Wilhelm
Cuno
s
government
and
an
attempt
by
the
German
Communist
Party
KPD
to
stage
a
revolution
The
reaction
to
these
events
was
an
upsurge
of
nationalist
sentiment
Nazi
Party
membership
grew
sharply
to
about
20
000
64
By
November
Hitler
had
decided
that
the
time
was
right
for
an
attempt
to
seize
power
in
Munich
in
the
hope
that
the
Reichswehr
the
post
war
German
military
would
mutiny
against
the
Berlin
government
and
join
his
revolt
In
this
he
was
influenced
by
former
General
Erich
Ludendorff
who
had
become
a
supporter
though
not
a
member
of
the
Nazis
On
the
night
of
8
November
the
Nazis
used
a
patriotic
rally
in
a
Munich
beer
hall
to
launch
an
attempted
putsch
coup
d
tat
This
so
called
Beer
Hall
Putsch
attempt
failed
almost
at
once
when
the
local
Reichswehr
commanders
refused
to
support
it
On
the
morning
of
9
November
the
Nazis
staged
a
march
of
about
2
000
supporters
through
Munich
in
an
attempt
to
rally
support
Troops
opened
fire
and
16
Nazis
were
killed
Hitler
Ludendorff
and
a
number
of
others
were
arrested
and
were
tried
for
treason
in
March
1924
Hitler
and
his
associates
were
given
very
lenient
prison
sentences
While
Hitler
was
in
prison
he
wrote
his
semi
autobiographical
political
manifesto
Mein
Kampf
My
Struggle
The
Nazi
Party
was
banned
on
9
November
1923
though
with
support
of
the
nationalist
V

Social

of
power
Adolf
Hitler
was
released
from
prison
on
20
December
1924
On
16
February
1925
Hitler
convinced
the
Bavarian
authorities
to
lift
the
ban
on
the
NSDAP
and
the
party
was
formally
refounded
on
26
February
1925
with
Hitler
as
its
undisputed
leader
The
new
Nazi
Party
was
no
longer
a
paramilitary
organization
and
disavowed
any
intention
of
taking
power
by
force
In
any
case
the
economic
and
political
situation
had
stabilized
and
the
extremist
upsurge
of
1923
had
faded
so
there
was
no
prospect
of
further
revolutionary
adventures
The
Nazi
Party
of
1925
was
divided
into
the
Leadership
Corps
Korps
der
politischen
Leiter
appointed
by
Hitler
and
the
general
membership
Parteimitglieder
The
party
and
the
SA
were
kept
separate
and
the
legal
aspect
of
the
party
s
work
was
emphasized
In

this

Westphalia
along
with
working
class
Red
Berlin
were
always
the
Nazis
weakest
areas
electorally
even
during
the
Third
Reich
itself
The
areas
of
strongest
Nazi
support
were
in
rural
Protestant
areas
such
as
Schleswig
Holstein
Mecklenburg
Pomerania
and
East
Prussia
Depressed
working
class
areas
such
as
Thuringia
also
produced
a
strong
Nazi
vote
while
the
workers
of
the
Ruhr
and
Hamburg
largely
remained
loyal
to
the
Social
Democrats
the
Communist
Party
of
Germany
or
the
Catholic
Centre
Party
Nuremberg
remained
a
Nazi
Party
stronghold
and
the
first
Nuremberg
Rally
was
held
there
in
1927
These
rallies
soon
became
massive
displays
of
Nazi
paramilitary
power
and
attracted
many
recruits
The
Nazis
strongest
appeal
was
to
the
lower
middle
classes
farmers
public
servants
teachers
and
small
businessmen
who
had
suffered
most
from
the
inflation
of
the
1920s
so
who
feared
Bolshevism
more
than
anything
else
The
small
business
class
was
receptive
to
Hitler
s
antisemitism
since
it
blamed
Jewish
big
business
for
its
economic
problems
University
students
disappointed
at
being
too
young
to
have
served
in
the
War
of

and
attracted
by
the

radical
rhetoric
also
became
a
strong
Nazi
constituency
By
1929
the
party
had
130
000
members
69
The
party
s
nominal
Deputy
Leader
was
Rudolf
Hess
but
he
had
no
real
power
in
the
party
By
the
early
1930s
the
senior
leaders
of
the
party
after
Hitler
were
Heinrich
Himmler
Joseph
Goebbels
and
Hermann
G
ring
Beneath
the
Leadership
Corps
were
the
party
s
regional
leaders
the
Gauleiters
each
of
whom
commanded
the
party
in
his
Gau
region
Goebbels
began
his
ascent
through
the
party
hierarchy
as
Gauleiter
of
Berlin
Brandenburg
in
1926
Streicher
was
Gauleiter
of
Franconia
where
he
published
his
antisemitic
newspaper
Der
St
rmer
Beneath
the
Gauleiter
were
lower
level
officials
the
Kreisleiter
county
leaders
Zellenleiter
cell
leaders
and
Blockleiter
block
leaders
This
was
a
strictly
hierarchical
structure
in
which
orders
flowed
from
the
top
and
unquestioning
loyalty
was
given
to
superiors
Only
the
SA
retained
some
autonomy
Being
composed
largely
of
unemployed
workers
many
SA
men
took
the
Nazis
socialist
rhetoric
seriously
At
this
time
the
Hitler
salute
borrowed
from
the
Italian
fascists
and
the
greeting
Heil
Hitler
were
adopted
throughout
the
party

The
Nazis
contested
elections
to
the
national
parliament
the
Reichstag
and
to
the
state
legislature
the
Landtage
from
1924
although
at
first
with
little
success
The
National
Socialist
Freedom
Movement
polled
3
of
the
vote
in
the
December
1924
Reichstag
elections
and
this
fell
to
2
6
in
1928
State
elections
produced
similar
results
Despite
these
poor
results
and
despite
Germany
s
relative
political
stability
and
prosperity
during
the
later
1920s
the
Nazi
Party
continued
to
grow
This
was
partly
because
Hitler
who
had
no
administrative
ability
left
the
party
organization
to
the
head
of
the
secretariat
Philipp
Bouhler
the
party
treasurer
Franz
Xaver
Schwarz
and
business
manager
Max
Amann
The
party
had
a
capable
propaganda
head
in
Gregor
Strasser
who
was
promoted
to
national
organizational
leader
in
January
1928
These
men
gave
the
party
efficient
recruitment
and
organizational
structures
The
party
also
owed
its
growth
to
the
gradual
fading
away
of
competitor
nationalist
groups
such
as
the
German
National
People
s
Party
DNVP
As
Hitler
became
the
recognized
head
of
the
German
nationalists
other
groups
declined
or
were
absorbed
Despite
these
strengths
the
Nazi
Party
might
never
have
come
to
power
had
it
not
been
for
the
Great
Depression
and
its
effects
on
Germany
By
1930
the
German
economy
was
beset
with
mass
unemployment
and
widespread
business
failures
The
Social
Democrats
and
Communists
were
bitterly
divided
and
unable
to
formulate
an
effective
solution
this
gave
the
Nazis
their
opportunity
and
Hitler
s
message
blaming
the
crisis
on
the
Jewish
financiers
and
the
Bolsheviks
resonated
with
wide
sections
of
the
electorate
At
the
September
1930
Reichstag
elections
the
Nazis
won
18
3
of
the
votes
and
became
the
second
largest
party
in
the
Reichstag
after
the
Social
Democrats
Hitler
proved
to
be
a
highly
effective
campaigner
pioneering
the
use
of
radio
and
aircraft
for
this
purpose
His
dismissal
of
Strasser
and
his
appointment
of
Goebbels
as
the
party
s
propaganda
chief
were
major
factors
While
Strasser
had
used
his
position
to
promote
his
own
leftish
version
of
national
socialism
Goebbels
was
totally
loyal
to
Hitler
and
worked
only
to
improve
Hitler
s
image
The
1930
elections
changed
the
German
political
landscape
by
weakening
the
traditional
nationalist
parties
the
DNVP
and
the
DVP
leaving
the
Nazis
as
the
chief
alternative
to
the
discredited
Social
Democrats
and
the
Zentrum
whose
leader
Heinrich
Br
ning
headed
a
weak
minority
government
The
inability
of
the
democratic
parties
to
form
a
united
front
the
self
imposed
isolation
of
the
Communists
and
the
continued
decline
of
the
economy
all
played
into
Hitler
s
hands
He
now
came
to
be
seen
as
de
facto
leader
of
the
opposition
and
donations
poured
into
the
Nazi
Party
s
coffers
Some
major
business
figures
such
as
Fritz
Thyssen
were
Nazi
supporters
and
gave
generously
70
and
some
Wall
Street
figures
were
allegedly
involved
71
but
many
other
businessmen
were
suspicious
of
the
extreme
nationalist
tendencies
of
the
Nazis
and
preferred
to
support
the
traditional
conservative
parties
instead

During

and
into

Germany
s
political
crisis
deepened
In

Hitler
ran

against

incumbent
President

in

and

members
and

running

battles
with
the
SPD
and
Communist
paramilitaries
who
also
fought
each
other
reduced
some
German
cities
to
combat
zones
Paradoxically
although
the
Nazis
were
among
the
main
instigators
of
this
disorder
part
of
Hitler
s
appeal
to
a
frightened
and
demoralised
middle
class
was
his
promise
to
restore
law
and
order
Overt
antisemitism
was
played
down
in
official
Nazi
rhetoric
but
was
never
far
from
the
surface
Germans
voted
for
Hitler
primarily
because
of
his
promises
to
revive
the
economy
by
unspecified
means
to
restore
German
greatness
and
overturn
the
Treaty
of
Versailles
and
to
save
Germany
from
communism
On
24
April
1932
the
Free
State
of
Prussia
elections
to
the
Landtag
resulted
in
36
3
of
the
votes
or
162
seats
for
Hitler
s
party
NSDAP
On
20
July
1932
the
Prussian
government
was
ousted
by
a
coup
the
Preussenschlag
and
a
few
days
later
at
the
July
1932
Reichstag
election
the
Nazis
made
another
leap
forward
polling
37
4
and
becoming
the
largest
party
in
parliament
by
a
wide
margin
Furthermore
the
Nazis
and
the
Communists
between
them
won
52
of
the
vote
and
a
majority
of
seats
Since
both
parties
opposed
the
established
political
system
and
neither
would
join
or
support
any
ministry
this
made
the
formation
of
a
majority
government
impossible
The
result
was
weak
ministries
governing
by
decree
Under
Comintern
directives
the
Communists
maintained
their
policy
of
treating
the
Social
Democrats
as
the
main
enemy
calling
them
social
fascists
thereby
splintering
opposition
to
the
Nazis
73
Later
both
the
Social
Democrats
and
the
Communists
accused
each
other
of
having
facilitated
Hitler
s
rise
to
power
by
their
unwillingness
to
compromise
Chancellor
Franz
von
Papen
called
another
Reichstag
election
in
November
hoping
to
find
a
way
out
of
this
impasse
The
electoral
result
was
the
same
with
the
Nazis
and
the
Communists
winning
50
of
the
vote
between
them
and
more
than
half
the
seats
rendering
this
Reichstag
no
more
workable
than
its
predecessor
However
support
for
the
Nazis
had
fallen
to
33
1
suggesting
that
the
Nazi
surge
had
passed
its
peak
possibly
because
the
worst
of
the
Depression
had
passed
possibly
because
some
middle
class
voters
had
supported
Hitler
in
July
as
a
protest
but
had
now
drawn
back
from
the
prospect
of
actually
putting
him
into
power
The
Nazis
interpreted
the
result
as
a
warning
that
they
must
seize
power
before
their
moment
passed
Had
the
other
parties
united
this
could
have
been
prevented
but
their
shortsightedness
made
a
united
front
impossible
Papen
his
successor
Kurt
von
Schleicher
and
the
nationalist
press
magnate
Alfred
Hugenberg
spent
December
and
January
in
political
intrigues
that
eventually
persuaded
President
Hindenburg
that
it
was
safe
to
appoint
Hitler
as
Reich
Chancellor
at
the
head
of
a
cabinet
including
only
a
minority
of
Nazi
ministers

However
a

identify

of
politics
75
When
asked
in
an
interview
in
1934
whether
the
Nazis
were
bourgeois
right
wing
as
alleged
by
their
opponents
Hitler
responded
that
Nazism
was
not
exclusively
for
any
class
and
indicated
that
it
favoured
neither
the
left
nor
the
right
but
preserved
pure
elements
from
both
camps
by
stating
From
the
camp
of

tradition
it
takes
national
resolve
and
from
the
materialism
of

faction

Hitler
was
appointed
as
Chancellor
of
Germany
on
30
January
1933
The
Reichstag
fire
on
27
February
1933
gave
Hitler
a
pretext
for
suppressing
his
political
opponents
The
following
day
on
28
February
he
persuaded
Reich
s
President
Paul
von
Hindenburg
to
issue
the
Reichstag
Fire
Decree
which
suspended
most
civil
liberties
The
NSDAP
won
the
parliamentary
election
on
5
March
1933
with
43
9
percent
of
votes
but
failed
to
win
an
absolute

After

reasons

of

civil

the

issued
a

On

gave
the

this
gave

During
Hitler
s
term
as
Chancellor
of
Germany
After
taking
power
intertwining
of
party
and
state
During
June
and
July
1933
all
competing
parties
were
either
outlawed
or
dissolved
themselves
and
subsequently
the
Law
against
the
founding
of
new
parties
of
14
July
1933
legally
established
the
Nazi
Party
s
monopoly
On
1
December
1933
the
Law
to
secure
the
unity
of
party
and
state
entered
into
force
which
was
the
base
for
a
progressive
intertwining
of
party
structures
and
state
apparatus
81
By
this
law
the
SA
actually
a
party
division
was
given
quasi
governmental
authority
and
their
leader
was
co
opted
as
an
ex
officio
cabinet
member
By
virtue
of
30
January
1934
Law
about
the
reorganisation
of
the
Reich
the
L
nder
states
lost
their
statehood
and
were
demoted
to
administrative
divisions
of
the
Reich
s
government
Gleichschaltung
Effectively
they
lost
most
of
their
power
to
the
Gaue
that
were
originally
just
regional
divisions
of
the
party
but
took
over
most
competencies
of
the
state
administration
in
their
respective
sectors
82
During
the
R
hm
Purge
of
30
June
to
2
July
1934
also
known
as
the
Night
of
the
Long
Knives
Hitler
disempowered
the
SA
s
leadership
most
of
whom
belonged
to
the
Strasserist
national
revolutionary
faction
within
the
NSDAP
and
ordered
them
killed
He
accused
them
of
having
conspired
to
stage
a
coup
d
tat
but
it
is
believed
that
this
was
only
a
pretence
to
justify
the
suppression
of
any
intraparty
opposition
The
purge
was
executed
by
the
SS
assisted
by
the
Gestapo
and
Reichswehr
units
Aside
from
Strasserist
Nazis
they
also
murdered
anti
Nazi
conservative
figures
like
former
chancellor
Kurt
von
Schleicher
83
After
this
the
SA
continued
to
exist
but
lost
much
of
its
importance
while
the
role
of
the
SS
grew
significantly
Formerly
only
a
sub
organisation
of
the
SA
it
was
created
a
separate
organisation
of
the
NSDAP
in
July
1934
84
After
the
death
of
President
Hindenburg
on
2
August
1934
Hitler
merged
the
offices
of
party
leader
head
of
state
and
chief
of
government
in
one
taking
the
title
of
F
hrer
und
Reichskanzler
The
Chancellery
of
the
F
hrer
officially
an
organisation
of
the
Nazi
Party
took
over
the
functions
of
the
Office
of
the
President
a
government
agency
blurring
the
distinction
between
structures
of
party
and
state
even
further
The
SS
increasingly
exerted
police
functions
a
development
which
was
formally
documented
by
the
merger
of
the
offices
of
Reichsf
hrer
SS
and
Chief
of
the
German
Police
on
17
June
1936
as
the
position
was
held
by
Heinrich
Himmler
who
derived
his
authority
directly
from
Hitler
85
The
Sicherheitsdienst
SD
formally
the
Security
Service
of
the
Reichsf
hrer
SS
that
had
been
created
in
1931
as
an
intraparty
intelligence
became
the
de
facto
intelligence
agency
of
Nazi
Germany
It
was
put
under
the
Reich
Main
Security
Office
RSHA
in
1939
which
then
coordinated
SD
Gestapo
and
criminal
police
therefore
functioning
as
a
hybrid
organisation
of
state
and
party
structures

Political
program
Main
article
National
Socialist
Program
The
National
Socialist
Program
was
a
formulation
of
the
policies
of
the
party
It
contained
25
points
and
is
therefore
also
known
as
the
25
point
plan
or
25
point
programme
It
was
the
official
party
programme
with
minor
changes
from
its
proclamation
as
such
by
Hitler
in
1920
when
the
party
was
still
the
German
Workers
Party
until
its
dissolution
Party
composition
Command
structure
Top
leadership
At
the
top
of
the
Nazi
Party
was
the
party
chairman
Der
F
hrer
who
held
absolute
power
and
full
command
over
the
party
All
other
party
offices
were
subordinate
to
his
position
and
had
to
depend
on
his
instructions
In
1934
Hitler
founded
a
separate
body
for
the
chairman
Chancellery
of
the
F
hrer
with
its
own
sub
units
Below
the
F
hrer
s
chancellery
was
first
the
Staff
of
the
Deputy
F
hrer
headed
by
Rudolf
Hess
from
21
April
1933
to
10
May
1941
and
then
the
Party
Chancellery
Parteikanzlei
headed
by
Martin
Bormann
Reichsleiter
Directly
subjected
to
the
F
hrer
were
the
Reichsleiter
Reich
Leader
s
the
singular
and
plural
forms
are
identical
in
German
whose
number
was
gradually
increased
to
eighteen
They
held
power
and
influence
comparable
to
the
Reich
Ministers
in
Hitler
s
Cabinet
The
eighteen
Reichsleiter
formed
the
Reich
Leadership
of
the
Nazi
Party
Reichsleitung
der
NSDAP
which
was
established
at
the
so
called
Brown
House
in
Munich
Unlike
a
Gauleiter
a
Reichsleiter
did
not
have
individual
geographic
areas
under
their
command
but
were
responsible
for
specific
spheres
of
interest
Political
leadership
corps
The
political
leadership
corps
of
the
Nazi
Party
were
those
persons
who
were
most
often
associated
as
being
Nazis
in
the
stereotypical
sense
of
the
word
as
it
was
these
individuals
who
wore
brown
paramilitary
Nazi
uniforms
enforced
Nazi
doctrine
and
ran
local
government
affairs
in
accordance
with
instructions
from
the
Nazi
Party
89
The
political
leadership
corps
encompassed
a
vast
array
of
paramilitary
titles
at
the
top
of
which
were
Gauleiter
who
were
party
leaders
of
large
geographical
areas
From
the
Gauleiters
extended
downwards
through
Nazi
positions
encompassing
county
city
and
town
leaders
all
of
whom
were
unquestioned
rulers
in
their
particular
areas
and
regions
90
To
the
very
end
of
its
existence
the
Nazi
Party
claimed
to
respect
the
traditional
government
of
Germany
and
to
that
end
local
and
state
governments
were
allowed
to
exist
side
by
side
with
regional
Nazi
leaders
However
by
1936
the
local
governments
had
lost
nearly
all
power
to
their
Nazi
counterparts
or
were
now
controlled
by
persons
who
held
both
government
and
Nazi
titles
alike
This
led
to
the
continued
existence
of
German
titles
such
as
B
rgermeister
as
well
as
the
existence
of
German
state
legislatures
Landesrat
but
without
any
real
power
to
speak
of
91
Ordinary
members
The
general
Nazi
Party
membership
were
known
by
the
title
of
Parteimitglieder
This
generic
term
applied
to
any
member
of
the
Party
who
did
not
otherwise
hold
a
political
leadership
position
Translated
simply
as
Party
Member
the
Parteimitglieder
could
and
did
hold
positions
in
other
Nazi
groups
such
as
the
SS
or
Sturmabteilung
The
only
insignia
for
the
Parteimitglieder
was
a
Nazi
Party
lapel
pin
Nazi
Party
members
who
held
no
leadership
posts
had
no
specific
designated
uniform
Such
persons
often
wore
uniforms
of
other
Nazi
groups
uniforms
of
German
government
agencies
and
could
also
serve
in
the
German
armed
forces
A
special
designation
of
Parteigenosse
Party
Comrade
was
reserved
for
Nazi
Party
members
who
had
been
members
of
the
party
since
the
1920s
and
early
30s
most
of
whom
were
also
personal
associates
of
Hitler
Nazi
Party
offices
The
Nazi
Party
had
a
number
of
party
offices
dealing
with
various
political
and
other
matters
These
included
Rassenpolitisches
Amt

RPA

Paramilitary
groups
In
addition
to
the
Nazi
Party
proper
several
paramilitary
groups
existed
which
supported
Nazi
aims
All
members
of
these
paramilitary
organizations
were
required
to
become
regular
Nazi
Party
members
first
and
could
then
enlist
in
the
group
of
their
choice
An
exception
was
the
Waffen
SS
considered
the
military
arm
of
the
SS
and
Nazi
Party
which
during
the
Second
World
War
allowed
members
to
enlist
without
joining
the
Nazi
Party
Foreign
volunteers
of
the
Waffen
SS
were
also
not
required
to
be
members
of
the
Nazi
Party
although
many
joined
local
nationalist
groups
from
their
own
countries
with
the
same
aims
Police
officers
including
members
of
the
Gestapo
frequently
held
SS
rank
for
administrative
reasons
known
as
rank
parity
and
were
likewise
not
required
to
be
members
of
the
Nazi
Party
A
vast
system
of
Nazi
Party
paramilitary
ranks
developed
for
each
of
the
various
paramilitary
groups
The
major
Nazi
Party
paramilitary
groups
were
as
follows
Schutzstaffel
SS
Protection
Squadron
both
Allgemeine
SS
and
Waffen
SS
Sturmabteilung
SA
Storm
Division
Nationalsozialistisches
Fliegerkorps
NSFK
National
Socialist
Flyers
Corps
Nationalsozialistisches
Kraftfahrerkorps
NSKK
National
Socialist
Motor
Corps
The
Hitler
Youth
was
a
paramilitary
group
divided
into
an
adult
leadership
corps
and
a
general
membership
open
to
boys
aged
fourteen
to
eighteen
The
League
of
German
Girls
was
the
equivalent
group
for
girls
Affiliated
organizations
Certain
nominally
independent
organizations
had
their
own
legal
representation
and
own
property
but
were
supported
by
the
Nazi
Party
Many
of
these
associated
organizations
were
labour
unions
of
various
professions
Some
were
older
organizations
that
were
nazified

For
the
purpose
of
centralization
in
the
Gleichschaltung
process
a
rigidly
hierarchal
structure
was
established
in
the
Nazi
Party
which
it
later
carried
through
in
the
whole
of
Germany
in
order
to
consolidate
total
power
under
the
person
of
Hitler
F
hrerstaat
It
was
regionally
sub
divided
into
a
number
of
Gaue
singular
Gau
headed
by
a
Gauleiter
who
received
their
orders
directly
from
Hitler
The
name
originally
a
term
for
sub
regions
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
headed
by
a
Gaugraf
for
these
new
provincial
structures
was
deliberately
chosen
because
of
its
mediaeval
connotations
The
term
is
approximately
equivalent
to
the
English
shire
After
the
Anschluss
a
new
type
of
administrative
unit
was
introduced
called
a
Reichsgau
In
these
territories
the
Gauleiters
also
held
the
position
of
Reichsstatthalter
thereby
formally
combining
the
spheres
of
both
party
and
state
offices
The
establishment
of
this
type
of
district
was
subsequently
carried
out
for
any
further
territorial
annexations
of
Germany
both
before
and
during
World
War
II
The
Gaue
and
Reichsgaue
state
or
province
were
further
sub
divided
into
Kreise
counties
headed
by
a
Kreisleiter
which
were
in
turn
sub
divided
into
Zellen
cells
and
Blocken
blocks
headed
by
a
Zellenleiter
and
Blockleiter
respectively
A
reorganization
of
the
Gaue
was
enacted
on
1
October
1928
The
given
numbers
were
the
official
ordering
numbers
The
statistics
are
from
1941
for
which
the
Gau
organization
of
that
moment
in
time
forms
the
basis
Their
size
and
populations
are
not
exact
for
instance
according
to
the
official
party
statistics
the
Gau
Kurmark
Mark
Brandenburg
was
the
largest
in
the
German
Reich
92
By
1941
there
were
42
territorial
Gaue
for
Germany
93
7
of
them
for
Austria
the
Sudetenland
in
Czechoslovakia
Danzig
and
the
Territory
of
the
Saar
Basin
along
with
the
unincorporated
regions
under
German
control
known
as
the
Protectorate
of
Bohemia
Moravia
and
the
General
Government
established
after
the
joint
invasion
of
Poland
by
Nazi
Germany
and
the
Soviet
Union
in
1939
at
the
onset
of
World
War
II
94
Getting
the
leadership
of
the
individual
Gaue
to
cooperate
with
one
another
proved
difficult
at
times
since
there
was
constant
administrative
and
financial
jockeying
for
control
going
on
between
them
95
The
table
below

the
organizational
structure
that
existed
before
its
dissolution
in
1945

the

Gaue

1932
the
number
had
risen
to
11
845
reflecting
the
party
s
growth
in
this
period
100
When
it
came
to
power
in
1933
the
Nazi
Party
had
over
2
million
members
In
1939
the
membership
total
rose
to
5
3
million
with
81
being
male
and
19
being
female
It
continued
to
attract
many
more
and
by
1945
the
party
reached
its
peak
of
8
million
with
63
being
male
and
37
being

about

Military
membership
Nazi
members
with
military
ambitions
were
encouraged
to
join
the
Waffen
SS
but
a
great
number
enlisted
in
the
Wehrmacht
and
even
more
were
drafted
for
service
after
World
War
II
began
Early
regulations
required
that
all
Wehrmacht
members
be
non
political
and
any
Nazi
member
joining
in
the
1930s
was
required
to
resign
from
the
Nazi
Party
However
this
regulation
was
soon
waived
and
there
is
ample
evidence
that
full
Nazi
Party
members
served
in
the
Wehrmacht
in
particular
after
the
outbreak
of
World
War
II
The
Wehrmacht
Reserves
also
saw
a
high
number
of
senior
Nazis
enlisting
with
Reinhard
Heydrich
and
Fritz
Todt
joining
the
Luftwaffe
as
well
as
Karl
Hanke
who
served
in
the
army
Student
membership
In
1926
the
party
formed
a
special
division
to
engage
the
student
population
known
as
the
National
Socialist
German
Students
League
NSDStB
A
group
for
university
lecturers
the
National
Socialist
German
University
Lecturers
League
NSDDB
also
existed
until
July
1944
Women
membership
The
National
Socialist
Women
s
League
was
the
women
s
organization
of
the
party
and
by
1938
it
had
approximately
2
million
members
Membership
outside
Germany
Party
members
who
lived
outside
Germany
were
pooled
into
the
Auslands
Organisation
NSDAP
AO
Foreign
Organization
The
organization
was
limited
only
to
so
called
Imperial
Germans
and
Ethnic
Germans
Volksdeutsche
who
did
not
hold
German
citizenship
were
not
permitted
to

Deutsche
Gemeinschaft
was
a
branch
of
the
Nazi
Party
founded
in
1919
created
for
Germans
with
Volksdeutsche
status
102
It
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
post
war
right
wing
Deutsche
Gemeinschaft
de
which
was
founded
in
1949
Notable

Party
symbols
Nazi
flags
The
Nazi
Party
used
a
right
facing
swastika
as
their
symbol
and
the
red
and
black
colours
were
said
to
represent
Blut
und
Boden
blood
and
soil
Another
definition
of
the
flag
describes
the
colours
as
representing
the
ideology
of
National
Socialism
the
swastika
representing
the
Aryan
race
and
the
Aryan
nationalist
agenda
of
the
movement
white
representing
Aryan
racial
purity
and
red
representing
the
socialist
agenda
of
the
movement
Black
white
and
red
were
in
fact
the
colours
of
the
old
North
German
Confederation
flag
invented
by
Otto
von
Bismarck
based
on
the
Prussian
colours
black
and
white
and
the
red
used
by
northern
German
states
In
1871
with
the
foundation
of
the
German
Reich
the
flag
of
the
North
German
Confederation
became
the
German
Reichsflagge
Reich
flag
Black
white
and
red
became
the
colours
of
the
nationalists
through
the
following
history
for
example
World
War
I
and
the
Weimar
Republic
The
Parteiflagge
design
with
the
centred
swastika
disc
served
as
the
party
flag
from
1920
Between
1933
when
the
Nazi
Party
came
to
power
and
1935
it
was
used
as
the
National
flag
Nationalflagge
and
Merchant
flag
Handelsflagge
but
interchangeably
with
the
black
white
red
horizontal
tricolour
In
1935
the
black
white
red
horizontal
tricolour
was
scrapped
again
and
the
flag
with
the
off
centre
swastika
and
disc
was
instituted
as
the
national
flag
and
remained
as
such
until
1945
The
flag
with
the
centred
disk
continued
to
be
used
after
1935
but
exclusively
as
the
Parteiflagge
the
flag
of
the
party
German
eagle
The
Nazi
Party
used
the
traditional
German
eagle
standing
atop
of
a
swastika
inside
a
wreath
of
oak
leaves
It
is
also
known
as
the
Iron
Eagle
When
the
eagle
is
looking
to
its
left
shoulder
it
symbolises
the
Nazi
Party
and
was
called
the
Parteiadler
In
contrast
when
the
eagle
is
looking
to
its
right
shoulder
it
symbolises
the
country
Reich
and
was
therefore
called
the
Reichsadler
After
the
Nazi
Party
came
to
national
power
in
Germany
they
replaced
the
traditional
version
of
the
German
eagle
with
the
modified
party
symbol
throughout
the
country
and
all
its
institutions
Parteiflagge

used
1920
1945
and
also
used
as
the

and

interchangeably
with
the
black
white
red
horizontal
tricolour
Flag
with
the

and

which
was
used
as
the

stated
Today
our
left
wing
politicians
in
particular
are
constantly
insisting
that
their
craven
hearted
and
obsequious
foreign
policy
necessarily
results
from
the
disarmament
of
Germany
whereas
the
truth
is
that
this
is
the
policy
of
traitors
But
the
politicians
of
the
Right
deserve
exactly
the
same
reproach
It
was
through
their
miserable
cowardice
that
those
ruffians
of
Jews
who
came
into
power
in
1918
were
able
to
rob
the
nation
of
its
arms

History
and
purpose
edit
The
first
Nazi
Party
rallies
took
place
in
1923
in
Munich
and
in
1926
in
Weimar
From
1927
on
they
took
place
exclusively
in
Nuremberg
The
Party
selected
Nuremberg
for
pragmatic
reasons
it
was
in
the
center
of
the
German
Reich
and
the
local
Luitpoldhain
converted
parkland
was
well
suited
as
a
venue
In
addition
the
Nazis
could
rely
on
the
well
organized
local
branch
of
the
party
in
Franconia
then
led
by
Gauleiter
Julius
Streicher
The
Nuremberg
police
were
sympathetic
to
the
event
Later
the
location
was
justified
by
the
Nazi
Party
by
putting
it
into
the
tradition
of
the
Imperial
Diet
German
Reichstag
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
considered
the
First
Reich
After
1933
the
rallies
took
place
near
the
time
of
the
Autumnal
equinox
under
the
title
of
The
German
people
s
National
Party
days
Reichsparteitage
des
deutschen
Volkes
which
was
intended
to
symbolize
the
solidarity
between
the
German
people
and
the
Nazi
Party
This
point
was
further
emphasized
by
the
yearly
growing
number
of
participants
which
finally
reached
over
half
a
million
from
all
sections
of
the
party
the
army
and
the
state

Propaganda
films
edit
Official
films
for
the
rallies
began
in
1927
with
the
establishment
of
the
NSDAP
Nazi
Party
film
office
The
most
famous
films
were
made
by
Leni
Riefenstahl
for
the
rallies
between
1933
and
1935
Relating
to
the
theme
of
the
rally
she
called
her
first
movie
Victory
of
Faith
Der
Sieg
des
Glaubens
This
movie
was
taken
out
of
circulation
after
the
Night
of
the
Long
Knives
although
a
copy
survived
in
Britain
and
has
recently
been
made
available
on
the
Internet
Archive
for
public
viewing
The
rally
of
1934
became
the
setting
for
the
award
winning
Triumph
of
the
Will
Triumph
des
Willens
Several
generals
in
the
Wehrmacht
protested
over
the
minimal
army
presence
in
the
film
Hitler
apparently
proposed
modifying
the
film
to
placate
the
generals
but
Riefenstahl
refused
his
suggestion
She
did
agree
to
return
to
the
1935
rally
and
make
a
film
exclusively
about
the
Wehrmacht
which
became
Tag
der
Freiheit
Unsere
Wehrmacht
The
rallies
for
1936
and
1937
were
covered
in
Festliches
N
rnberg
which
was
shorter
than
the
others
only
21
minutes
Books
edit
There
were
two
sets
of
official
or
semi
official
books
covering
the
rallies
The
red
books
were
officially
published
by
the
NSDAP
and
contained
the
proceedings
of
the
congress
as
well
as
full
texts
of
every
speech
given
in
chronological
order
The
blue
books
were
published
initially
by
Julius
Streicher
the
Gauleiter
of
Nuremberg
later
by
Hanns
Kerrl
not
by
the
party
press
These
were
larger
scale
books
that
included
the
text
of
speeches
and
proceedings
as
well
as
larger
photographs
In
addition
to
these
collections
of
Heinrich
Hoffman
s
photographs
were
published
to
commemorate
each
Party
congress
as
well
as
pamphlets
of
Hitler
s
speeches
Both
series
of
books
are
much
sought
after
collectors

June
1932
Adolf
Hitler
s
rise
to
power
began
in
Germany
in
September
1919
a
when
Hitler
joined
the
political
party
known
as
the
Deutsche
Arbeiterpartei
DAP
German
Workers
Party
The
name
was
changed
in
1920
to
the
Nationalsozialistische
Deutsche
Arbeiterpartei
NSDAP
National
Socialist
German
Workers
Party
commonly
known
as
the
Nazi
Party
This
political
party
was
formed
and
developed
during
the
post
World
War
I
era
It
was
anti
Marxist
and
opposed
to
the
democratic
post
war
government
of
the
Weimar
Republic
and
the
Treaty
of
Versailles
and
it
advocated
extreme
nationalism
and
Pan
Germanism
as
well
as
virulent
anti
Semitism
Hitler
s
rise
can
be
considered
to
have
ended
in
March
1933
after
the
Reichstag
adopted
the
Enabling
Act
of
1933
in
that
month
President
Paul
von
Hindenburg
had
already
appointed
Hitler
as
Chancellor
on
30
January
1933
after
a
series
of
parliamentary
elections
and
associated
backroom
intrigues
The
Enabling
Act
when
used
ruthlessly
and
with
authority
virtually
assured
that
Hitler
could
thereafter
constitutionally
exercise
dictatorial
power
without
legal
objection
Adolf
Hitler
rose
to
a
place
of
prominence
in
the
early
years
of
the
party
Being
one
of
the
best
speakers
of
the
party
he
told
the
other
members
to
either
make
him
leader
of
the
party
or
he
would
never
return
He
was
aided
in
part
by
his
willingness
to
use
violence
in
advancing
his
political
objectives
and
to
recruit
party
members
who
were
willing
to
do
the
same
The
Beer
Hall
Putsch
in
November
1923
and
the
later
release
of
his
book
Mein
Kampf
Translation
My
Struggle
introduced
Hitler
to
a
wider
audience
In
the
mid
1920s
the
party
engaged
in
electoral
battles
in
which
Hitler
participated
as
a
speaker
and
organizer
b
as
well
as
in
street
battles
and
violence
between
the
Rotfrontk
mpferbund
and
the
Nazis
Sturmabteilung
SA
Through
the
late
1920s
and
early
1930s
the
Nazis
gathered
enough
electoral
support
to
become
the
largest
political
party
in
the
Reichstag
and
Hitler
s
blend
of
political
acuity
deceptiveness
and
cunning
converted
the
party
s
non
majority
but
plurality
status
into
effective
governing
power
in
the
ailing
Weimar
Republic
of
1933
Once
in
power
the
Nazis
created
a
mythology
surrounding
the
rise
to
power
and
they
described
the
period
that
roughly
corresponds
to
the
scope
of
this

was

Apparently
his
skills
in
oratory
as
well
as
his
extreme
and
open
anti
Semitism
caught
the
eye
of
an
approving
army

In

Hitler
was
appointed
Verbindungsmann
intelligence
agent
of

commando
of
the
Reichswehr
both
to
influence
other
soldiers
and
to
infiltrate

German
Workers

The
DAP
had
been
formed
by
Anton

Karl
Harrer
and
others
through
amalgamation
of
other
groups
on
5
January
1919
at
a
small
gathering
in
Munich
at
the
restaurant
Fuerstenfelder
Hof
While
he
studied

During
the
12

meeting
j
Hitler
took
umbrage
with
comments
made
by
an
audience
member
that
were
directed
against
Gottfried
Feder
the
speaker
a
crank
economist
with
whom
Hitler
was
acquainted
due
to
a
lecture
Feder
delivered
in

course

The
audience

Hitler
in
Mein

disparagingly
called
him
the
professor
asserted
that
Bavaria
should
be
wholly
independent
from
Germany
and
should
secede
from
Germany
and
unite
with
Austria
to
form
a
new
South
German
nation

The
volatile
Hitler
arose
and
scolded
the
unfortunate
Professor

using
his
speaking
skills
and
eventually
causing
Baumann
to
leave
the
meeting
before

Impressed
with
Hitler
s
oratory
skills
Drexler
encouraged
him
to
join
the
DAP
On
the
orders
of
his
army
superiors
Hitler
applied
to
join
the
party
10
Within
a
week
Hitler
received
a
postcard
stating
he
had
officially
been
accepted
as
a
member
and
he
should
come
to
a
committee
meeting
to
discuss
it
Hitler
attended
the
committee
meeting
held
at
the
run
down
Alte
Rosenbad
beer
house
11
Later
Hitler
wrote
that
joining
the
fledgling
party
was
the
most
decisive
resolve
of
my
life
From
here
there
was
and
could
be
no
turning
back
I
registered
as
a
member
of
the
German
Workers
Party
and
received
a
provisional
membership
card

the
number

Normally
enlisted
army
personnel
were
not
allowed
to
join
political
parties
However
in
this
case
Hitler
had
Captain

permission
to
join

m
Hitler
s
considerable
oratory
and
propaganda
skills
were
appreciated
by
the
party
leadership
With
the
support
of
Anton
Drexler
Hitler
became
chief
of
propaganda
for
the
party
in
early
1920
and
his
actions
began
to
transform
the
party
He
organised
their
biggest
meeting
yet
of
2
000
people
on
24
February
1920
in
the
Staatliches
Hofbr
uhaus
in
M

There
Hitler
announced
the
party
s
25

He
engineered
the
name
change
of
the
DAP
to
the
Nationalsozialistische

National

Party
commonly
known
to
the

Hitler
designed
the
party
s
banner
of
a
swastika
in
a
white
circle
on
a
red
background
18
Hitler
was
later
discharged
from
the
army
in
March
1920
and
began
working
full
time
for
the
NSDAP
19
In
1920
a
small
hall
protection
squad
was
organised
around
Emil
Maurice
20
The
group
was
first
named
the
Order
troops
Ordnertruppen
Later
in
August
1921
Hitler
redefined
the
group
which
became
known
as
the
Gymnastic
and
Sports
Division
of
the
party
Turn
und
Sportabteilung
21
By
the
autumn
of
1921
the
group
was
being
called
the
Sturmabteilung
Storm
Detachment
or
SA
and
in
November
1921
the
group
was
officially
known
by
that
name
22
Throughout
1920
Hitler
began
to
lecture
at
Munich
s
beer
halls
particularly
the
Hofbr
uhaus
Sterneckerbr
u
and
B
rgerbr
ukeller
Only
Hitler
was
able
to
bring
in
the
crowds
for
the
party
speeches
and
meetings
23
By
this
time
the
police
were
already
monitoring
the
speeches
and
their
own
surviving
records
reveal
that
Hitler
delivered
lectures
with
titles
such
as
Political
Phenomenon
Jews
and
the
Treaty
of
Versailles
At
the
end
of
the
year
party
membership
was
recorded
at
2
000

In
June
1921
while
Hitler
and
Dietrich
Eckart
were
on
a
fundraising
trip
to
Berlin
a
mutiny
broke
out
within
the
NSDAP
in
Munich
Members
of
its
executive
committee
wanted
to
merge
with
the
rival
German
Socialist
Party
DSP
25
Hitler
returned
to
Munich
on
11
July
and
angrily
tendered
his
resignation
The
committee
members
realised
that
the
resignation
of
their
leading
public
figure
and
speaker
would
mean
the
end
of
the
party
26
Hitler
announced
he
would
rejoin
on
the
condition
that
he
would
replace
Drexler
as
party
chairman
and
that
the
party
headquarters
would
remain
in
Munich
27
The
committee
agreed
and
he
rejoined
the
party
on
26
July
as
member
3
680
27
In
the
following
days
Hitler
spoke
to
several
packed
houses
and
defended
himself
to
thunderous
applause
His
strategy
proved
successful
at
a
general
membership
meeting
he
was
granted
absolute
powers
as
party
chairman
with
only
one
nay
vote
cast
28
On
14
September
1921
Hitler
and
a
substantial
number
of
SA
members
and
other
Nazi
Party
adherents
disrupted
a
meeting
at
the
L
wenbr
ukeller
of
the
Bavarian
League
This
federalist
organization
objected
to
the
centralism
of
the
Weimar
Constitution
but
accepted
its
social
program
The
League
was
led
by
Otto
Ballerstedt
an
engineer
whom
Hitler
regarded
as
my
most
dangerous
opponent
One
Nazi
Hermann
Esser
climbed
upon
a
chair
and
shouted
that
the
Jews
were
to
blame
for
the
misfortunes
of
Bavaria
and
the
Nazis
shouted
demands
that
Ballerstedt
yield
the
floor
to
Hitler
29
The
Nazis
beat
up
Ballerstedt
and
shoved
him
off
the
stage
into
the
audience
Both
Hitler
and
Esser
were
arrested
and
Hitler
commented
notoriously
to
the
police
commissioner
It
s
all
right
We
got
what
we
wanted
Ballerstedt
did
not
speak
30
Hitler
was
eventually
sentenced
to
3
months
imprisonment
and
ended
up
serving
only
a
little
over
one
month
On
4
November
1921
the
Nazi
Party
held
a
large
public
meeting
in
the
Munich
Hofbr
uhaus
After
Hitler
had
spoken
for
some
time
the
meeting
erupted
into
a
melee
in
which
a
small
company
of
SA
defeated
the
opposition

In
1922
and
early

Hitler
and
the
NSDAP
formed
two
organizations
that
would
grow
to
have
huge
significance
The
first
began
as
the
Jungsturm
Adolf
Hitler
and
the
Jugendbund
der

they
would
later
become

the
proper
strategy
to
seize
control

the
country

was
put
on
trial
for
high
treason
gaining

The
rather
spectacular
trial
began
in
February

Hitler
endeavored
to
turn
the
tables
and
put
democracy

the
Weimar
Republic
on
trial
as
traitors
to
the
German
people
Hitler
was
convicted

on

sentenced
to
five
years
imprisonment

in

though
in
three
areas
the
NSDAP
failed
to
gain
even

of
the
vote
Overall
the
NSDAP
gained
2

810
100
of
the
vote
39
Partially
due
to
the
poor
results
Hitler
decided
that
Germans
needed
to
know
more
about
his
goals
Despite
being
discouraged
by
his
publisher
he
wrote
a
second
book
that
was
discovered
and
released
posthumously
as
the
Zweites
Buch
At
this
time
the
SA
began
a
period
of
deliberate
antagonism
to
the
Rotfront
by
marching
into
Communist
strongholds
and
starting
violent
altercations
At
the
end
of
1928
party
membership
was
recorded
at
130
000
In
March
1929
Erich
Ludendorff
represented
the
Nazi
Party
in
the
Presidential
elections
He
gained
280
000
votes
1
1
and
was
the
only
candidate
to
poll
fewer
than
a
million
votes
The
battles
on
the
streets
grew
increasingly
violent
After
the
Rotfront
interrupted
a
speech
by
Hitler
the
SA
marched
into
the
streets
of
Nuremberg
and
killed
two
bystanders
In
a
tit
for
tat
action
the
SA
stormed
a
Rotfront
meeting
on
25
August
and
days
later
the
Berlin
headquarters
of
the
Communist
Party
of
Germany
KPD
itself
In
September
Goebbels
led
his
men
into
Neuk
lln
a
KPD
stronghold
and
the
two
warring
parties
exchanged
pistol
and
revolver
fire
The
German
referendum
of
1929
was
important
as
it
gained
the
Nazi
Party
recognition
and
credibility
it
never
had
before
On
the
evening
of
14
January
1930
at
around
ten
o
clock
Horst
Wessel
was
fatally
shot
at
point
blank
range
in
the
face
by
two
members
of
the
KPD
in
Friedrichshain
40
The
attack
occurred
after
an
argument
with
his
landlady
who
was
a
member
of
the
KPD
and
contacted
one
of
her
Rotfront
friends
Albert
Hochter
who
shot
Wessel
41
Wessel
had
penned
a
song
months
before
which
would
become
a
Nazi
anthem
as
the
Horst
Wessel
Lied
Goebbels
seized
upon
the
attack
and
the
weeks
Wessel
spent
on
his
deathbed
to
publicize
the
song
and
the
funeral
was
used
as
an
anti
Communist
propaganda
opportunity
for
the
Nazis
42
In
May
Goebbels
was
convicted
of
libeling
President
Hindenberg
and
fined
800
marks
It
stemmed
from
a
1929
article
by
Goebbels
in
his
newspaper
Der
Angriff
In
June
Goebbels
was
charged
with
high
treason
by
the
prosecutor
in
Leipzig
based
on
statements
Goebbels
had
made
in
1927
but
after
a
four
month
investigation
it
came
to
naught

An
unprecedented
amount
of
money
was
thrown
behind
the
campaign
Well
over
one
million
pamphlets
were
produced
and
distributed
sixty
trucks
were
commandeered

use
in

alone
In
areas
where
NSDAP
campaigning
was
less
rigorous
the

was

Depression
was
also
a
factor
in

s
electoral
success
Against
this

backdrop
the

began
its

major
anti

action

and
the
Communists
made
great
gains
at
the
1930
Election
45
Both
the
Nazis
and
Communists
between
them
secured
almost
40
of
Reichstag
seats
which
required
the
moderate
parties
to
consider

The

Germany
s
Weimar
political
system
made
it

From

the

A

exist
the
People

and
the

suffered
severe
losses
to
the
Nazis
at
the
polls
The
Social
Democrats
were
essentially
a
conservative
trade

party
with
ineffectual
leadership

was
so
far
from
recognizing
the
danger
of
a
Nazi
dictatorship
that
it
continued
to
negotiate
with
the
Nazis
The
Communists
meanwhile
were
engaging
in
violent
clashes
with
Nazis
on
the
streets
but
Moscow
had
directed
the
Communist
Party
to
prioritise
destruction
of
the
Social
Democrats
seeing
more
danger
in
them
as
a
rival
for
the
loyalty
of
the
working
class
Nevertheless
wrote
Bullock
the
heaviest
responsibility
lay
with
the
German
Right
who
forsook
a
true
conservatism
and
made
Hitler
their
partner
in
a

Chancellor
Franz

The
Centre

s
Heinrich
Br

was
Chancellor
from
1930
to
1932
Br
ning
and
Hitler
were
unable
to
reach

co
operation
but
Br
ning
himself
increasingly
governed
with
the
support
of
the
President
and

over

50
The
84
year
old
President
von
Hindenburg
a
conservative
monarchist
was
reluctant
to
take
action
to
suppress
the
Nazis
while
the
ambitious
Major
General
Kurt
von
Schleicher
as
Minister
handling
army
and
navy
matters
hoped
to
harness
their
support
51
With
Schleicher
s
backing
and
Hitler
s
stated
approval
Hindenburg
appointed
the
Catholic
monarchist
Franz
von
Papen
to
replace
Br

At

Elections
the
Nazis
became
the
largest
party
in

without

Hitler
withdrew

He

dissolved

On
10
March
1931
with
street
violence
between
the
Rotfront
and
SA
spiraling
out
of
control
breaking
all
previous
barriers
and
expectations
Prussia
re
enacted
its
ban
on
brown
shirts
Days
after
the
ban
SA
men
shot
dead
two
communists
in
a
street
fight
which
led
to
a
ban
being
placed
on
the
public
speaking
of
Goebbels
who
sidestepped
the
prohibition
by
recording
speeches
and
playing
them
to
an
audience
in
his
absence
When
Hitler
s
citizenship
became
discussion
in
1924
he
had
a
public
declaration
printed
on
16
October
1924
The
loss
of
my
Austrian
citizenship
is
not
painful
to
me
as
I
never
felt
as
an
Austrian
citizen
but
always
as
a
German
only
It
was
this
mentality
that
made
me
draw
the
ultimate
conclusion
and
do
military
service
in
the
German
Army
61
Under
the
threat
of
criminal
deportation
home
to
Austria
Hitler
formally
renounced
his
Austrian
citizenship
on
7
April
1925
and
did
not
acquire
German
citizenship
until
almost
seven
years
later
therefore
he
was
unable
to
run
for
public
office
62
Hitler
gained
German
citizenship
after
being
appointed
a
Free
State
of
Brunswick
government
official
by
Wilhelm
Frick
after
an
earlier
attempt
to
convey
citizenship
as
a
Thuringian
police

The
deaths
mounted
with
many
more
on
the
Rotfront
side
and
by
the
end
of
1931
the
SA
had
suffered
47
deaths

the
Rotfront
recorded
losses
of
approximately
80
Street
fights
and
beer
hall
battles
resulting
in
deaths
occurred
throughout
February
and
April
1932
all
against
the
backdrop
of
Adolf
Hitler
s
competition
in
the
presidential
election
which
pitted
him
against
the
monumentally
popular
Hindenburg
In
the
first
round
on
13
March
Hitler
had
polled
over
11
million
votes
but
was
still
behind
Hindenburg
The

and
final
round
took

At
this
time
the
Nazi
Party
had
just
over

card
carrying
members
Three
days
after
the
presidential
elections
the
German
government
banned
the
NSDAP
paramilitaries
the
SA
and
the
SS
on
the
basis
of
the
Emergency
Decree
for
the
Preservation
of
State
Authority
65
66
This
action
was
largely
prompted
by
details
that
emerged
at
a
trial
of
SA
men
for
assaulting
unarmed
Jews
in
Berlin
After
less
than
a
month
the
law
was
repealed
on
30
May
by
Franz
von
Papen
Chancellor
of
Germany
Such
ambivalence
about
the
fate
of
Jews
was
supported
by
the
culture
of
anti
Semitism
that
pervaded
the
German
public
at
the
time
Dwarfed
by
Hitler
s
electoral
gains
the
KPD
turned
away
from
legal
means
and
increasingly
towards
violence
One
resulting
battle
in
Silesia
resulted
in
the
army
being
dispatched
each
shot
sending
Germany
further
into
a
potential
all
out
civil
war
By
this
time
both
sides
marched
into
each
other
s
strongholds
hoping
to
spark
a
rivalry
The
attacks
continued
and
reached
fever
pitch
when
SA
leader
Axel
Schaffeld
was
assassinated
At
the
end
of
July
1932
the
Nazi
Party
gained
13
745

votes

securing
230
out
of
608
seats
in
the
Reichstag
39
As
the
NSDAP
was
now
the
largest
party
in
the
Reichstag
they
were
thus
entitled
to
select
the
President
of
the
Reichstag
and
were
able
to
elect
G
ring
for
the
post
67
Energised
by
the
incredible
results
Hitler
asked
to
be
made
chancellor
Hitler
was
offered
the
job
of
vice
chancellor
by
Chancellor
Papen
at
the
behest
of
President
Hindenburg
but
he
refused
Hitler
saw
this
offer
as
placing
him
in
a
position
of
playing
second
fiddle
in
the
government
68
G
ring
in
his
position
of
Reichstag
president
asked
that
decisive
measures
be
taken
by
the
government
over
the
spate
in
murders
of
NSDAP
members
On
9
August
amendments
were
made
to
the
Reichstrafgesetzbuch
statute
on
acts
of
political
violence
increasing
the
penalty
to
lifetime
imprisonment
20
years
hard
labour
or
death
Special
courts
were
announced
to
try
such
offences
When
in
power
less
than
half
a
year
later
Hitler
would
use
this
legislation
against
his
opponents
with
devastating
effect
The
law
was
applied
almost
immediately
but
did
not
bring
the
perpetrators
behind
the
recent
massacres
to
trial
as
expected
Instead
five
SA
men
who
were
alleged
to
have
murdered
a
KPD
member
in
Potempa
Upper
Silesia
were
tried
Hitler
appeared
at
the
trial
as
a
defence
witness
but
on
22
August
the
five
were
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death
On
appeal
this
sentence
was
commuted
to
life
imprisonment
in
early
September
They
would
serve
just
over
four
months
before
Hitler
freed
all
imprisoned
Nazis
in
a
1933
amnesty
The
Nazi
Party
lost
35
seats
in
the
November
1932
election
but
remained
the
Reichstag
s
largest
party
with
196
seats
33
09
The
Social
Democrats
SPD
won
121
seats
20
43
and
the
Communists
KPD
won
100
16
86
The
Comintern
described
all
moderate
left
wing
parties
as
social
fascists
and
urged
the
Communists
to
devote
their
energies
to
the
destruction
of
the
moderate
left
As
a
result
the
KPD
following
orders
from
Moscow
rejected
overtures
from
the
Social
Democrats
to
form
a
political
alliance
against
the
NSDAP
After
Chancellor
Papen
left
office
he
secretly
told
Hitler
that
he
still
held
considerable
sway
with
President
Hindenburg
and
that
he
would
make
Hitler
chancellor
as
long
as
he
Papen
could
be
the
vice
chancellor
Another
notable
event
was
the
publication
of
the
Industrielleneingabe
a
letter
signed
by
22
important
representatives
of
industry
finance
and
agriculture
asking
Hindenburg
to
appoint
Hitler
as
chancellor
Hindenburg
reluctantly
agreed
to
appoint
Hitler
as
chancellor
after
the
parliamentary
elections
of
July
and
November
1932
had
not
resulted
in
the
formation
of
a
majority
government
Hitler
headed
a
short
lived
coalition
government
formed
by
the
NSDAP
and
the
German
National
People
s
Party
DNVP
On
30
January
1933
the
new
cabinet
was
sworn
in
during
a
brief
ceremony
in
Hindenburg
s
office
The
NSDAP
gained
three
posts
Hitler
was
named
chancellor
Wilhelm
Frick
Minister
of
the
Interior
and
Hermann
G
ring
Minister
Without
Portfolio
and
Minister
of
the
Interior
for
Prussia
69
70
The
SA
and
SS
led
torchlit
parades
throughout
Berlin
Papen
was
to
serve
as
Vice
Chancellor
in
a
majority
conservative
Cabinet
still
falsely
believing
that
he
could
tame
Hitler
53
Initially
Papen
did
speak
out
against
some
Nazi
excesses
However
after
narrowly
escaping
death
in
the
Night
of
the
Long
Knives
in
1934
he
no
longer
dared
criticise
the
regime
and
was
sent
off
to
Vienna
as
German
ambassador
71
Both
within
Germany
and
abroad
initially
there
were
few
fears
that
Hitler
could
use
his
position
to
establish
his
later
dictatorial
single
party
regime
Rather
the
conservatives
that
helped
to
make
him
chancellor
were
convinced
that
they
could
control
Hitler
and
tame
the
Nazi
Party
while
setting
the
relevant
impulses
in
the
government
themselves
foreign
ambassadors
played
down
worries
by
emphasizing
that
Hitler
was
mediocre
if
not
a
bad
copy
of
Mussolini
even
SPD
politician
Kurt
Schumacher
trivialized
Hitler
as
a
Dekorationsst
ck
piece
of
scenery
decoration
of
the
new
government
German
newspapers
wrote
that
without
doubt
the
Hitler
led
government
would
try
to
fight
its
political
enemies
the
left
wing
parties
but
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
establish
a
dictatorship
in
Germany
because
there
was
a
barrier
over
which
violence
cannot
proceed
and
because
of
the
German
nation
being
proud
of
the
freedom
of
speech
and
thought
Theodor
Wolff
of
Frankfurter
Zeitung
wrote
72
It
is
a
hopeless
misjudgement
to
think
that
one
could
force
a
dictatorial
regime
upon
the
German
nation

Even
within
the
Jewish
German
community
in
spite
of
Hitler
not
hiding
his
ardent
antisemitism
the
worries
appear
to
have
been
limited
In
a
declaration
of
January
30
the
steering
committee
of
the
central
Jewish
German
organization
Centralverein
deutscher
Staatsb
rger
j
dischen
Glaubens
wrote
that
as
a
matter
of
course
the
Jewish
community
faces
the
new
government
with
the
largest
mistrust
but
at
the
same
they
were
convinced
that
nobody
would
dare
to
touch
their
constitutional
rights
The
Jewish
German
newspaper
J
dische
Rundschau
de
wrote
on
Jan
31st
73
that
also
within
the
German
nation
still
the
forces
are
active
that
would
turn
against
a
barbarian
anti
Jewish
policy

However
a
growing
number
of
keen
observers
like
Sir
Horace
Rumbold
British
Ambassador
in
Berlin
began
to
revise
their
opinions
On
22
February
1933
he
wrote
Hitler
may
be
no
statesman
but
he
is
an
uncommonly
clever
and
audacious
demagogue
and
fully
alive
to
every
popular
instinct
and
he
informed
the
Foreign
Office
that
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
Nazis
had
come
to
stay
74
On
receiving
the
dispatch
Lord
Vansittart
Permanent
Under
Secretary
of
State
for
Foreign
Affairs
concluded
that
if
Hitler
eventually
gained
the
upper
hand
then
another
European
war
was
within
measurable
distance
75
With
Germans
who
opposed
Nazism
failing
to
unite
against
it
Hitler
soon
moved
to
consolidate
absolute
power
At
the
risk
of
appearing
to
talk
nonsense
I
tell
you
that
the
National
Socialist
movement
will
go
on
for
1
000
years
Don
t
forget
how
people
laughed
at
me
15
years
ago
when
I
declared
that
one
day
I
would
govern
Germany
They
laugh
now
just
as
foolishly
when
I
declare
that
I
shall
remain
in
power

Terminology
edit
The
German
term
Machtergreifung
seizure
of
power
which
is
also
used
by
English
historians
is
a
term
originally
used
by
some
Nazis
to
suggest
a
revolutionary
process
77
though
Hitler
and
others
used
the
word
Macht
bernahme
take
over
of
power
reflecting
that
the
transfer
of
power
took
place
within
the
existing
constitutional
framework
77
and
suggesting
that
the
process
was
legal

Adolf
Hitler
addressing
the
Reichstag
on
23
March
1933
Seeking
assent
to
the
Enabling
Act
Hitler
offered
the
possibility
of
friendly
co
operation
promising
not
to
threaten
the
Reichstag
the
President
the
States
or
the
Churches
if
granted
the
emergency
powers
Following
the
Reichstag
fire
the
Nazis
began
to
suspend
civil
liberties
and
eliminate
political
opposition
The
Communists
were
excluded
from
the
Reichstag
At
the
March
1933
elections
again
no
single
party
secured
a
majority
Hitler
required
the
vote
of
the
Centre
Party
and
Conservatives
in
the
Reichstag
to
obtain
the
powers
he
desired
80
He
called
on
Reichstag
members
to
vote
for
the
Enabling
Act
on
24
March
1933
Hitler
was
granted
plenary
powers
temporarily
by
the
passage
of
the
Act
80
The
law
gave
him
the
freedom
to
act
without
parliamentary
consent
and
even
without
constitutional
limitations
81
Employing
his
characteristic
mix
of
negotiation
and
intimidation
Hitler
offered
the
possibility
of
friendly
co
operation
promising
not
to
threaten
the
Reichstag
the
President
the
States
or
the
Churches
if
granted
the
emergency
powers
With
Nazi
paramilitary
encircling
the
building
he
said
It
is
for
you
gentlemen
of
the
Reichstag
to
decide
between
war
and
peace
80
The
Centre
Party
having
obtained
promises
of
non
interference
in
religion
joined
with
conservatives
in
voting
for
the
Act
only
the
Social
Democrats
voted
against
82
The
Act
allowed
Hitler
and
his
Cabinet
to
rule
by
emergency
decree
for
four
years
though
Hindenburg
remained
President
83
Hitler
immediately
set
about
abolishing
the
powers
of
the
states
and
the
existence
of
non
Nazi
political
parties
and
organisations
84
Non
Nazi
parties
were
formally
outlawed
on
14
July
1933
and
the
Reichstag
abdicated
its
democratic
responsibilities
84
The
Act
did
not
infringe
upon
the
powers
of
the
President
and
Hitler
would
not
fully
achieve
full
dictatorial
power
until
after
the
death
of
Hindenburg
in
August
1934
85
Hindenburg
remained
commander
in
chief
of
the
military
and
retained
the
power
to
negotiate
foreign
treaties

The
dates
chosen
for
such
periods
can
be
somewhat
arbitrary
It
was
starting
with
Hitler
s
decision
in
the
Pomeranian
hospital
to
enter
politics
and
only
concluding
with
for
example
his
removal
of
R
hm
1934
or
his
bloodless
conquest
of
Czechoslovakia
1937
or
even
his
military
conquest
of
France
1940
The
article
simply
uses
Hitler
s
decision
to
join
the
party
as
the
start
date
of
the
rise
and
the
adoption
of
the
Enabling
Act
as
its
completion
While
that
is
not
the
only
possible
interpretation
it
is
certainly
a
reasonable
one
He
could
not
at
this
time
run
for
political
office
in
Germany
as
he
was
not
then
a
German
citizen

the

consequences
of

Days

I

Hitler
having
been
born
in
the
defunct
Austro
Hungarian
Empire
to
Austrian
parents
was
not
a
German
citizen
but
had
managed
to
enlist
in
a
Bavarian
regiment
where
he
served
on
the
front
lines
as
a
runner
He
was
wounded
twice
in
action
at
the
time
of
the
Armistice
he
was
recovering
in
a
German
hospital
in
Pomerania
northeast
of
Berlin
from
temporary
blindness
that
had
resulted
from
a
mid
October
British

Toland

Toland
suggests
that
Hitler
s
assignment
to
this
department
was
partially
a
reward
for
his
exemplary
service
in
the
front
lines
and
partially
because
the
responsible
officer
felt
sorry
for
Hitler
as
having
no
friends
but
being
very
willing
to
do
whatever
the
army
required
Toland

Apparently
someone
in
an
army
educational
session
had
made
a
remark
that
Hitler
deemed
pro
Jewish
and
Hitler
reacted
with
characteristic
ferocity
Shirer
states
that
Hitler
had
attracted
the
attention
of
a
right
wing
university
professor
who
was
engaged
to
educate
enlisted
men
in
proper
political
belief
and
that
the
professor

recommendation
to
an
officer
resulted
in
Hitler

advancement

The

by

a
powerful
slogan
for

Hitler

According
to
Shirer
the
seemingly
preposterous
South
German
nation
idea
actually
had
some
popularity
in
Munich
in
the
politically
raucous
atmosphere
of
Bavaria
following
the

Shirer

The
membership
numbers
were
artificially
started
at
501
because
the
DAP
wanted
to
make
itself
look
larger
than
it
actually
was
The
membership
numbers
were
also
apparently
issued
alphabetically
and
not
chronologically
so
one
cannot
infer
that
Hitler
was
in
fact

The

Nazi
is
a
contraction

The
propaganda
used
by
the
German
Nazi
Party
in
the
years
leading
up
to
and
during
Adolf
Hitler
s
leadership
of
Germany
1933
1945
was
a
crucial
instrument
for
acquiring
and
maintaining
power
and
for
the
implementation
of
Nazi
policies
The
pervasive
use
of
propaganda
by
the
Nazis
is
largely
responsible
for
the
word
propaganda
itself
acquiring
its
present
negative
connotations

Nazi
leader
Adolf
Hitler
devoted
three
chapters
of
his
1925
26
book
Mein
Kampf
itself
a
propaganda
tool
to
the
study
and
practice
of
propaganda
2
He
claimed
to
have
learned
the
value
of
propaganda
as
a
World
War
I
infantryman
exposed
to
very
effective
British
and
ineffectual
German
propaganda
3
The
argument
that
Germany
lost
the
war
largely
because
of
British
propaganda
efforts
expounded
at
length
in
Mein
Kampf
reflected
then
common
German
nationalist
claims
Although
untrue
German
propaganda
during
World
War
I
was
mostly
more
advanced
than
that
of
the
British
it
became
the
official
truth
of
Nazi
Germany
thanks
to
its
reception
by
Hitler
4
Mein
Kampf
contains
the
blueprint
of
later
Nazi
propaganda
efforts
Assessing
his
audience
Hitler
writes
in
chapter
VI
Propaganda
must
always
address
itself
to
the
broad
masses
of
the
people
All
propaganda
must
be
presented
in
a
popular
form
and
must
fix
its
intellectual
level
so
as
not
to
be
above
the
heads
of
the
least
intellectual
of
those
to
whom
it
is
directed
The
art
of
propaganda
consists
precisely
in
being
able
to
awaken
the
imagination
of
the
public
through
an
appeal
to
their
feelings
in
finding
the
appropriate
psychological
form
that
will
arrest
the
attention
and
appeal
to
the
hearts
of
the
national
masses
The
broad
masses
of
the
people
are
not
made
up
of
diplomats
or
professors
of
public
jurisprudence
nor
simply
of
persons
who
are
able
to
form
reasoned
judgment
in
given
cases
but
a
vacillating
crowd
of
human
children
who
are
constantly
wavering
between
one
idea
and
another
The
great
majority
of
a
nation
is
so
feminine
in
its
character
and
outlook
that
its
thought
and
conduct
are
ruled
by
sentiment
rather
than
by
sober
reasoning
This
sentiment
however
is
not
complex
but
simple
and
consistent
It
is
not
highly
differentiated

As
to
the
methods
to
be
employed
he
explains
Propaganda
must
not
investigate
the
truth
objectively
and
in
so
far
as
it
is
favourable
to
the
other
side
present
it
according
to
the
theoretical
rules
of
justice
yet
it
must
present
only
that
aspect
of
the
truth
which
is
favourable
to
its
own
side
The
receptive
powers
of
the
masses
are
very
restricted
and
their
understanding
is
feeble
On
the
other
hand
they
quickly
forget
Such
being
the
case
all
effective
propaganda
must
be
confined
to
a
few
bare
essentials
and
those
must
be
expressed
as
far
as
possible
in
stereotyped
formulas
These
slogans
should
be
persistently
repeated
until
the
very
last
individual
has
come
to
grasp
the
idea
that
has
been
put
forward
Every
change
that
is
made
in
the
subject
of
a
propagandist
message
must
always
emphasize
the
same
conclusion
The
leading
slogan
must
of
course
be
illustrated
in
many
ways
and
from
several
angles
but
in
the
end
one
must
always
return
to
the
assertion
of
the
same
formula
Hitler
put
these
ideas
into
practice
with
the
reestablishment
of
the
V
lkischer
Beobachter
a
daily
newspaper
published
by
the
Nazi
Party
NSDAP
from
February
1925
onwards
whose
circulation
reached
26
175
in
1929
It
was
joined
in
1927
by
Joseph
Goebbels
s
Der
Angriff
another
unabashedly
and
crudely
propagandistic
paper
During
most
of
the
Nazis
time
in
opposition
their
means
of
propaganda
remained
limited
With
little
access
to
mass
media
the
party
continued
to
rely
heavily
on
Hitler
and
a
few
others
speaking
at
public
meetings
until
1929

One
study
finds
that
the
Weimar
government
s
use
of
pro

retarded
Nazi
growth

Goebbels

Goebbels
a

skills
Among

The
Third
Reich
established
a
Ministry
of
Propaganda
appointing
Joseph
Goebbels

Minister
Its
goals
were
to
establish
enemies
in

the
external
enemies

had

the
Treaty
of
Versailles
on
Germany
and
internal
enemies
such
as

Bolsheviks
and
cultural
trends
including

A
major
political
and

unification
of

Reich

In
Mein

Hitler
denounced
the
pain
and
misery
of
ethnic
Germans
outside
Germany
and
declared
the
dream
of
a
common
fatherland
for
which
all
Germans
must
fight
10
Throughout

he
pushed
Germans
worldwide

For
months
prior
to
the
beginning
of

War

in
1939
German
newspapers
and
leaders
had
carried
out
a
national

international
propaganda
campaign
accusing
Polish
authorities
of
organizing
or
tolerating
violent
ethnic
cleansing
of
ethnic
Germans
living
in
Poland

On

Adolf

The

The
main
part
of
this

was
the

was

Adolf
Hitler

The
Jews
were
blamed
for
things
such
as
robbing
the
German
people
of
their
hard
work
while
themselves
avoiding

labour
Hitler
declared
that
the

Hitler
asserted

Nuremberg
Laws
edit
In
1935
anti
semitic
laws
in
Nazi
Germany
were
introduced
known
as
the
Nuremberg
Laws
the
laws
forbid
non
Aryans
and
political
opponents
of
the
Nazis
from
the
civil
service
and
any
sexual
relations
and
marriage
between
people
classified
as
Aryan
and
non
Aryan
Jews
Gypsies
blacks
was
prohibited
as
Rassenschande
or
race
defilement
23
The
Nuremberg
Laws
were
based
on
notions
of
racial
purity
and
sought
to
preserve
the
Aryan
race
who
were
at
the
top
of
the
Nazi
racial
hierarchy
and
were
said
to
be
the
ubermenschen

race
24
and
to
teach
the
German
nation
to
view
the
Jews
as
subhumans
25
Political
opponents
edit
Soon
after
the
takeover
of
power
in
1933
Nazi
concentration
camps
were
established
for
political
opponents
The
first
people
that
were
sent
to
the
camps
were
Communists
26
They
were
sent
because
of
their
ties
with
the
Soviet
Union
and
because
Nazism
greatly
opposed
Communism
27
Nazi
propaganda
dismissed
the
Communists
as
Red
subhumans
28
Goebbels
used
the
death
of
Horst
Wessel
who
was
killed
in
1930
by
two
members
of
the
Communist
Party
of
Germany
as
a
propaganda

Treaty
of
Versailles
edit
When
the
Treaty
of
Versailles
was
signed
in
1919
non
propagandists
newspapers
headlines
across
the
nation
spoke
German
s
feelings
such
as
sch
ndlich
Unacceptable
which
appeared
on
the
front
page
of
the
Frankfurter
Zeitung
in
1919
The
Berliner
Tageblatt
also
in
1919
predicted
Should
we
accept
the
conditions
a
military
furore
for
revenge
will
sound
in
Germany
within
a
few
years
a
militant
nationalism
will
engulf
all
30
Hitler
knowing
his
nation
s
disgust
with
the
Treaty
used
it
as
leverage
to
influence
his
audience
He
would
repeatedly
refer
back
to
the
terms
of
the
Treaty
as
a
direct
attack
on
Germany
and
its
people
In
one
speech
delivered
on
30
January
1937
he
directly
stated
that
he
was
withdrawing
the
German
signature
from
the
document
to
protest
the
outrageous
proportions
of
the
terms
He
claimed
the
Treaty
made
Germany
out
to
be
inferior
and
less
of
a
country
than
others
only
because
blame
for
the
war
was
placed
on
it
The
success
of
Nazi
propagandists

posted

and
other
facilities
Until
the
conclusion
of
the
Battle
of
Stalingrad
on
2
February
1943
German
propaganda
emphasized
the
prowess
of
German
arms
and
the
humanity
German
soldiers
had
shown
to
the
peoples
of
occupied
territories
Pilots
of
the
Allied
bombing
fleets
were
depicted
as
cowardly
murderers
and
Americans
in
particular
as
gangsters
in
the
style
of
Al
Capone
At
the
same
time
German
propaganda
sought
to
alienate
Americans
and
British
from
each
other
and
both
these
Western
nations
from
the
Soviet
Union
One
of
the
primary
sources
for
propaganda
was
the
Wehrmachtbericht
a
daily
radio
broadcast
from
the
High
Command
of
the
Wehrmacht
the
OKW
Nazi
victories
lent
themselves
easily
to
propaganda
broadcasts
and
were
at
this
point
difficult
to
mishandle
32
Satires
on
the
defeated
accounts
of
attacks
and
praise
for
the
fallen
all
were
useful
for
Nazis
33
Still
failures
were
not
easily
handled
even
at
this
stage
For
example
considerable
embarrassment
resulted
when
the
Ark
Royal
proved
to
have
survived
an
attack
that
German
propaganda
had
hyped
32
After
Stalingrad
the
main
theme
changed
to
Germany
as
the
sole
defender
of
what
they
called
Western
European
culture
against
the
Bolshevist
hordes
The
introduction
of
the
V
1
and
V
2
vengeance
weapons
was
emphasized
to
convince
Britons
of
the
hopelessness
of
defeating
Germany
Problems
in
propaganda
arose
easily
in
this
stage
expectations
of
success
were
raised
too
high
and
too
quickly
which
required
explanation
if
they
were
not
fulfilled
and
blunted
the
effects
of
success
and
the
hushing
of
blunders
and
failures
caused
mistrust
32
The
increasing
hardship
of
the
war
for
the
German
people
also
called
forth
more
propaganda
that
the
war
had
been
forced
on
the
German
people
by
the
refusal
of
foreign
powers
to
accept
their
strength
and
independence
32
Goebbels
called
for
propaganda
to
toughen
up
the
German
people
and
not
make
victory
look
easy
32
On
23
June
1944
the
Nazis
permitted
the
Red
Cross
to
visit
the
concentration
camp
Theresienstadt
to
dispel
rumors
about
the
Final
Solution
which
was
intended
to
kill
all
Jews
In
reality
Theresienstadt
was
a
transit
camp
for
Jews
en
route
to
extermination
camps
In
a
sophisticated
propaganda
effort
fake
shops
and
caf
s
were
erected
to
imply
that
the
Jews
lived
in
relative
comfort
The
guests
enjoyed
the
performance
of
a
children
s
opera
Brundibar
written
by
inmate
Hans
Kr

The
hoax
was
so
successful
for
the
Nazis
that
they
went
on
to
make
a
propaganda
film
Theresienstadt
Shooting
of
the
film
began
on
26
February
1944
Directed
by
Kurt
Gerron
it
was
meant
to
show
how
well
the
Jews
lived
under
the
benevolent
protection
of
the
Third
Reich
After
the
shooting
most
of
the
cast
and
even
the

were
deported
to
the

Anti

during

War
II
edit
Anti
semitic
wartime
propaganda
served
a
variety
of
purposes
It
was
hoped
that
people
in
Allied
countries
would
be
persuaded
that
Jews
should
be
blamed
for
the
war
The
Nazis
also
wished
to
ensure
that
German
people
were
aware
of
the
extreme
measures
being
carried
out
against
the
Jews
on
their
behalf
in
order
to
incriminate
them
and
thus
guarantee
their
continued
loyalty
through
fear
by
Nazi
conjectured
scenarios
of
supposed
post
war
Jewish
reprisals
34
35
Especially
from
1942
onwards
the
announcement
that
Jews
were
being
exterminated
served
as
a
group
unification
factor
to
preclude
desertion
and
force
the
Germans
to
continue
fighting
Germans
were
fed
the
knowledge
that
too
many
atrocities
had
been
committed

against

allow

understanding

be
reached

Books

The
Nazis
and
sympathizers
published
many
books
Most
of
the
beliefs
that
would
become
associated
with
the
Nazis
such
as
German
nationalism
eugenics
and
anti
Semitism
had
been
in
circulation
since
the
19th
century
and
the
Nazis
seized
on
this
body
of
existing
work
in
their
own
publications
The
most
notable
is
Adolf
Hitler
s
Mein
Kampf
detailing
his
beliefs
37
The
book
outlines
major
ideas
that
would
later
culminate
in
World
War
II
It
is
heavily
influenced
by
Gustave
Le
Bon
s
1895
The
Crowd
A
Study
of
the
Popular
Mind
which
theorized
propaganda
as
a
way
to
control
the
seemingly
irrational
behaviour
of
crowds
Particularly
prominent
is
the
violent
anti
Semitism
of
Hitler
and
his
associates
drawing
among
other
sources
on
the
fabricated
Protocols
of
the
Elders
of
Zion
1897
which
implied
that
Jews
secretly
conspired
to
rule
the
world
This
book
was
a
key
source
of
propaganda
for
the
Nazis
and
helped
fuel
their
common
hatred
against
the
Jews
during
World
War
II
38
For
example
Hitler
claimed
that
the
international
language
Esperanto
was
part
of
a
Jewish
plot
and
makes
arguments
toward
the
old
German
nationalist
ideas
of
Drang
nach
Osten
and
the
necessity
to
gain
Lebensraum

eastwards
especially
in
Russia
Other
books

as

attempt
to
identify
and
classify
the
differences
between
the
German
Nordic
or
Aryan
type
and
other
supposedly
inferior
peoples
These
books
were
used
as
texts
in
German
schools
during
the
Nazi
era
The
pre
existing
and
popular
genre
of
Schollen
roman
or
novel
of
the
soil
also
known
as
blood
and
soil
novels
39
was
given
a
boost
by
the
acceptability
of
its
themes
to
the
Nazis
and
developed
a
mysticism
of
unity
40
The
immensely
popular
Red
Indian
stories
by
Karl
May
were
permitted
despite
the
heroic
treatment
of
the
hero
Winnetou
and
colored
races
instead
the
argument
was
made
that
the
stories
demonstrated
the
fall
of
the
Red
Indians
was
caused
by
a
lack
of
racial
consciousness
to
encourage
it
in
the
Germans
41
Other
fictional
works
were
also
adapted
Heidi
was
stripped
of
its
Christian
elements
and
Robinson
Crusoe
s
relationship
to
Friday
was
made
a
master
slave
one
42
Children
s
books
also
made
their
appearance
In
1938
Julius
Streicher
published
Der
Giftpilz
The
Poisonous
Mushroom
a
storybook
that
equated
the
Jewish
people
to
poisonous
mushrooms
and
aimed
to
educate
children
about
the
Jews
The
book
was
an
example
of
anti
Semitic
propaganda
and
stated
that
The
following
tales
tell
the
truth
about
the
Jewish
poison
mushroom
They
show
the
many
shapes
the
Jew
assumes
They
show
the
depravity
and
baseness
of
the
Jewish
race
They
show
the
Jew
for
what
he
really
is
The
Devil
in
human
form

would
often
show
that
the
birth

amongst
Slavs
was
prolific
compared
to
Germans
45
Geography

stated
how

would

of
disabled
children
as

to
healthy
ones
or
show
how
two
child
families
threatened
the
birthrate
47
Math
books
discussed
military
applications
and
used
military
word
problems
physics
and
chemistry
concentrated
on
military
applications
and
grammar
classes
were
devoted
to
propaganda
sentences
48
Other
textbooks
dealt
with
the
history
of
the
Nazi
Party
49
Elementary
school
reading
text
included
large
amounts
of
propaganda
50
Children
were
taught
through
textbooks
that
they
were
the
Aryan
master
race
Herrenvolk
while
the
Jews
were
untrustworthy
parasitic
and
Untermenschen
inferior
subhumans
51
Course
content
and
textbooks
unnecessarily
included
information
that
was
propagandistic
an
attempt
to
sway
the
children
s
views
from
an
early
age
52
Maps
showing
the
racial
composition
of
Europe
were
banned
from
the
classroom
after
many
efforts
that
did
not
define
the
territory
widely
enough
for
party
officials
53
Even
fairy
tales
were
put
to
use
with
Cinderella
being
presented
as
a
tale
of
how
the
prince
s
racial
instincts
lead
him
to
reject
the
stepmother
s
alien
blood
present
in
her
daughters
for
the
racially
pure
maiden
54
Nordic
sagas
were
likewise
presented
as
the
illustration
of
F
hrerprinzip
which
was
developed
with
such
heroes
as
Frederick
the
Great
and
Otto
von
Bismarck
55
Literature
was
to
be
chosen
within
the
German
spirit
rather
than
a
fixed
list
of
forbidden
and
required
which
made
the
teachers
all
the
more
cautious
56
although
Jewish
authors
were
impossible
for
classrooms
57
While
only
William
Shakespeare
s
Macbeth
and
The
Merchant
of
Venice
were
actually
recommended
none
of
the
plays
were
actually
forbidden
even
Hamlet
denounced
for
flabbiness
of
soul
58
Biology
texts
however
were
put
to
the
most
use
in
presenting
eugenic
principles
and
racial
theories
this
included
explanations
of
the
Nuremberg
Laws
which
were
claimed
to
allow
the
German
and
Jewish
peoples
to
co
exist
without
the
danger
of
mixing
59
Science
was
to
be
presented
as
the
most
natural
area
for
introducing
the
Jewish
Question
once
teachers
took
care
to
point
out
that
in
nature
animals
associated
with
those
of
their
own
species
60
Teachers
guidelines
on
racial
instruction
presented
both
the
handicapped
and
Jews
as
dangers
61
Despite
their
many
photographs
glamorising
the
Nordic
type
the
texts
also
claimed
that
visual
inspection
was
insufficient
and
genealogical
analysis
was
required
to
determine
their
types
and
report
any
hereditary
problems
62
However
the
National
Socialist
Teachers
League
NSLB
stressed
that
at
primary
schools
in
particular
they
had
to
work
on
only
the
Nordic
racial
core
of
the
German
Volk
again
and
again
and
contrast
it
with
the
racial
composition
of
foreign
populations
and
the
Jews
51
Books
for
occupied
countries
edit
In
occupied
France
the
German
Institute
encouraged
translation
of
German
works
although
chiefly
German
nationalists
not
ardent
Nazis
produced
a
massive
increase
in
the
sale
of
translated
works
63
The
only
books
in
English
to
be
sold
were
English
classics
and
books
with
Jewish
authors
or
Jewish
subject
matter
such
as
biographies
were
banned
except
for
some
scientific
works
64
Control
of
the

allowed
Germans
the
easy
ability
to
pressure
publishers
about
books
64
Comics

The
Nazi
controlled
government
in
German
occupied
France
produced
the
Vica

during
World
War
II
as
a
propaganda
tool
against
the
Allied
forces
The
Vica
series
authored
by

represented
Nazi
influence
and
perspective
in

as

The
Nazis
produced
many
films
to
promote
their
views
using
the
party
s
Department
of
Film
for
organizing
film
propaganda
An
estimated
45
million
people
attended
film
screenings
put
on
by
the
NSDAP
66
Reichsamtsleiter
Neumann
declared
that
the
goal
of
the
Department
of
Film
was
not
directly
political
in
nature
but
was
rather
to
influence
the
culture
education
and
entertainment
of
the
general
population
66
On
22
September
1933
a
Department
of
Film
was
incorporated
into
the
Chamber
of
Culture
The
department
controlled
the
licensing
of
every
film
prior
to
its
production
Sometimes
the
government
selected
the
actors
for
a
film
financed
the
production
partially
or
totally
and
granted
tax
breaks
to
the
producers
Awards
for
valuable
films
would
decrease
taxes
thus
encouraging
self
censorship
among
movie
makers
67
Under
Goebbels
and
Hitler
the
German
film
industry
became
entirely
nationalised
The
National
Socialist
Propaganda
Directorate
which
Goebbels
oversaw
had
at
its
disposal
nearly
all
film
agencies
in
Germany
by
1936
Occasionally
certain
directors
such
as
Wolfgang
Liebeneiner
were
able
to
bypass
Goebbels
by
providing
him
with
a
different
version
of
the
film
than
would
be
released
Such
films
include
those
directed
by

1940
was
directed
by
Fritz
Hippler
at
the
insistence
of
Goebbels
though
the
writing
is
credited
to
Eberhard
Taubert
The
movie
is
done
in
the
style
of
a
documentary
the
central
thesis
being
the
immutable
racial
personality
traits
that
characterize
the
Jew
as
a
wandering
cultural
parasite
Throughout
the
film
these
traits
are
contrasted
to
the
Nazi
state
ideal
while
Aryan
men
find
satisfaction
in
physical
labour
and
the
creation
of
value
Jews
only
find
pleasure
in
money
and
a
hedonist
lifestyle
A
main
medium
was
Die
Deutsche
Wochenschau
a
newsreel
series
produced
for
cinemas
from
1940
Newsreels
were
explicitly
intended
to
portray
German
interests
as
successful
69
Themes
often
included
the
virtues
of
the
Nordic
or
Aryan
type
German
military
and
industrial
strength
and
the
evils
of

See

Degenerate
art
By
Nazi
standards
fine
art
was
not
propaganda
Its
purpose
was
to
create
ideals
for
eternity
71
This
produced
a
call
for
heroic
and
romantic
art
which
reflected
the
ideal
rather
than
the
realistic
53
Explicitly
political
paintings
were
very
rare
72
Still
more
rare
were
anti
Semitic
paintings
because
the
art
was
supposed
to
be
on
a
higher
plane
73
Nevertheless
selected
themes
common
in
propaganda
were
the
most
common
topics
of
art
Sculpture
was
used
as
an
expression
of
Nazi
racial
theories
74
The
most
common
image
was
of
the
nude
male
expressing
the
ideal
of
the
Aryan
race
75
Nudes
were
required
to
be
physically
perfect

were
also
popular

Magazines

In

after
1939
the
Zeitschriften
Dienst
was
sent
to
magazines
to
provide
guidelines
on
what
to
write
for
appropriate
topics
82
Nazi
publications
also
carried
various
forms
of
propaganda
Neues
Volk
was
a
monthly
publication
of
the
Office
of
Racial
Policy
which
answered
questions
about
acceptable
race
relations
83
While
mainly
focused
on
race
relations
it
also
included
articles
about
the
strength
and
character
of
the
Aryan
race
compared
to
Jews
and
other
defectives
84
The
NS
Frauen
Warte
aimed
at
women
included
such
topics
as
the
role
of
women
in
the
Nazi
state
85
Despite
its
propaganda
elements
it
was
predominantly
a
woman

magazine
86
It
defended
anti

87
urged
women
to

even
in

88
89
put

what
the

90
discussed

91
and
urged

92
Der

was
aimed
at
boys
and
contained
both
adventure
and

Signal
was
a
propaganda
magazine
published
by
the
Wehrmacht
during
World
War
II
95
and
distributed
throughout
occupied
Europe
and
neutral
countries
Published
from
April
1940
to
March
1945
Signal
had
the
highest
sales
of
any
magazine
published
in
Europe
during
the
period
circulation
peaked
at
2
5
million
in
1943
At
various
times
it
was
published
in
at
least
twenty
languages
An
English
edition
was
distributed
in
the
British
Channel
Islands
of
Guernsey
Jersey
Alderney
and
Sark
which
were
occupied
by
the
Wehrmacht
during
the
war
The
promoter
of
the
magazine
was
the
chief
of
the
Wehrmacht
propaganda
office
Colonel
Hasso
von
Wedel
Its
annual
budget
was
10
million
Reichmarks
roughly
2
5
million
at
the
pre
war
exchange
rate
The
image
that
Signal
transmitted
was
that
of
Nazi
Germany
and
its
New
Order
as
the
great
benefactor
of
European
peoples
and
of
Western
civilization
in
general
The
danger
of
a
Soviet
invasion
of
Europe
was
strongly
pointed
out
The
quality
of
the
magazine
itself
was
quite
high
featuring
complete
reviews
from
the
front
lines
rich
in
information
and
photos
even
displaying

many
of
the
most
famous
Second

photos
that
are
to

were
administered

to
1943
109
Word

posters
were
politically
skewed
and
meant
to
rally
public
opinion
in
support
of
the
Nazi
efforts
The
posters
set
out
to
educate
and
unify
the
German
people

and
especially
during
World

Jeffery
Herf
author
of
The
Jewish
Enemy
Nazi
Propaganda
During
World
War
II
and
the
Holocaust
described
the
poster
campaign
as
a
combination
of
newspaper
editorial
political
leaflet
political
poster
and
tabloid
journalism
109
Adolf
Hitler
personally
appointed
artist
Hans
Schweitzer
known
as
Mj
lnir
with
the
task
of
translating
Nazi
ideology
into
images
for
the
wall
newspaper
110
The
posters
were
100
centimeters
high
and
212
centimeters
wide
109
The
visual
style
of
the
posters
was
bold
text
and
Nazi
influenced
colors
it
meant
to
capture
the
attention
of
the
German
passersby
The
text
was
big
so
that
several
people
could
read
it
at
the
same
time
and
from
a
distance
of
a
few
feet
109
The
majority
of
the
posters
were
centered
on
Jews
and
the
Allied
countries
of
Great
Britain
the
United
States
of
America
and
Russia
During
the
time
period
when
anti
Semitic
articles
decreased
in
publications
the
anti
Semitic
rhetoric
was
ramped
up
in
The
Word
of
the
Week
posters
From
1941
to
1943
about
twenty
five
percent
of
The
Word
Of
The
Week
posters
included
an
attack
on
Jews
109
The
Jews
were
depicted
as
enemies
because
of
their
supposed
economic
war
capitalism
and
connection
to
the
Bolshevik
revolution
in
Russia
110
The
Nazi
regime
fostered
the
idea
that
the
Jews
were
the
masterminds
behind
all
oppositional
political
force
Images
often
showed
a
Jewish
figure
positioned
behind
or
above
symbols
of
economic
and
political
influence
110
Additionally
it
was
also
common
to
depict
the
Allied
forces
of
Great
Britain
the
United
States
and
Russia
as
overtaken
by
Jewry
Posters
were
also
used
in
schools
depicting
for
instance
an
institution
for
the
feeble
minded
on
one
hand
and
houses
on
the
other
to
inform
the
students
that
the
annual
cost
of
this
institution
would
build
17
homes
for
healthy
families

Radio
edit
Before
Hitler
came
to
power
he
rarely
used
radio
to
connect
with
the
public
and
when
he
did
so
non
party
newspapers
were
allowed
to
publish
his
speeches
112
This
changed
soon
after
he
came
to
power
in
1933
Hitler
s
speeches
became
widely
broadcast
all
over
Germany
especially
on
the
radio
itself
introduced
by
the
Ministry
of
Propaganda
They
were
shown
in
weekly
newsreels
and
reprinted
in
large
editions
in
books
and
pamphlets
all
across
Germany
112
Hitler
s
speeches
became
so
significant
to
the
Nazis
that
even
restaurants
and
pubs
were
expected
have
their
radios
on
whenever
he
was
delivering
one
and
in
some
cities
public
speakers
were
used
so
passersby
could
hear
them
112
Nazi
propaganda
emphasized
and
portrayed
his
speeches
so
that
their
main
points
appeared
in
weekly
posters
and
were
all
over
Germany
by
the
hundreds
of
thousands
112
Nazi
propaganda
also
used
radio
as
an
important
tool
to
promote
genocide
113
Internal
broadcasts
edit
Recognising
the
importance
of
radio
in
disseminating
the
Nazi
message
Goebbels
approved
a
scheme
whereby
millions
of
cheap
radio
sets
the
Volksempf
nger
were
subsidised
by
the
government
In
the
Radio
as
the
Eighth
Great
Power
114
speech
Goebbels
proclaimed
It
would
not
have
been
possible
for
us
to
take
power
or
to
use
it
in
the
ways
we
have
without
the
radio
It
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
German
revolution
at
least
in
the
form
it
took
would
have
been
impossible
without
the
airplane
and
the
radio
Radio
reached
the
entire
nation
regardless
of
class
standing
or
religion
That
was
primarily
the
result
of
the
tight
centralization
the
strong
reporting
and
the
up
to
date
nature
of
the
German
radio
Above
all
it
is
necessary
to
clearly
centralize
all
radio
activities
to
place
spiritual
tasks
ahead
of
technical
ones
to
provide
a
clear
worldview
By
the
start
of
the
Second
World
War
over
70
of
German
households
had
one
of
these
radios
which
were
deliberately
limited
in
range
in
order
to
prevent
loyal
citizens
from
considering
other
viewpoints
in
foreign
broadcasts
113
Radio
broadcasts
were
also
played
over
loudspeakers
in
public
places
and
workplaces
113
In
private
homes
however
people
could
easily
turn
off
the
radio
when
bored
and
did
so
once
the
novelty
of
hearing
the
voice
from
a
box
wore
off
this
caused
the
Nazis
to
introduce
many
non
propaganda
elements
such
as
music
advice
and
tips
serials
and
other
entertainment
115
This
was
accelerated
during
the
war
to
prevent
people
from
tuning
in
enemy
propaganda
broadcasts
though
Goebbels
claimed
in
his
Das
Reich
article
that
it
was
to
make
the
radio
a
good
companion
to
the
people
he
admitted
the
truth
in
his
diary

Henriot
in

who
later
became
a
Vichy
minister
and
broadcaster
for
the
Nazis
As
well
as
domestic
broadcasts
the
Nazi
regime
used
radio
to
deliver
its
message
to
both
occupied
territories
and
enemy
states
One
of
the
main
targets
was
the
United
Kingdom
to
which
William
Joyce
broadcast
regularly
gaining
the
nickname
Lord
Haw
Haw
Joyce
first
appeared
on
German
radio
on
6
September
1939
reading
the
news
in
English
but
soon
became
noted
for
his
often
mischievous
propaganda
broadcasts
117
Joyce
was
executed
in
1946
for
treason
Although
Joyce
was
the
most
notorious
and
most
regularly
heard
of
British
propagandists
other
broadcasters
included
Norman
Baillie
Stewart
Jersey
born

also
broadcasting

Broadcasts
were
also
made
to
the
United

notably
by
Robert
Henry

and
Axis
Sally
Mildred
Gillars
Best
a
freelance
journalist
based
in
Vienna
was
initially
arrested
following
the
German
declaration
of

but
before
long
he
became
a
feature
on
propaganda
radio
attacking
the
influence
of
the
Jews
in
the
US
and
the
leadership
of
Franklin
Delano
Roosevelt
119
who
succeeded
Winston
Churchill
in
Nazi
propaganda
as
World
Enemy
Number

120
Best
was
later
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
for
treason
Gillars
a
teacher
in
Germany
mostly
broadcast
on
similar
themes
as
well
as
peppering
her
speech
with
allegations
of
infidelity
against
the
wives
of
servicemen
Her
most
notorious
broadcast
was
the
Vision
of
Invasion
radio
play
broadcast
immediately
prior
to
D

from
the
perspective
of
an
American
mother
who
dreamed
that
her
soldier
son
died
violently
in
Normandy
121
France
also
received
broadcasts
from
Radio
Stuttgart
where
Paul
Ferdonnet
an
anti
Semitic
journalist
was
the
main
voice
during
the
Phoney
War
122
Following
the
occupation
Radio
Paris
and
Radio
Vichy
became
the
main
organs
of
propaganda
with
leading
far
right
figures
such
as
Jacques
Doriot
Philippe
Henriot
and
Jean
H
rold
Paquis
regularly
speaking
in
support
of
the
Nazis
Others
who
broadcast
included
Gerald
Hewitt
a
British
citizen
who
lived
most
of
his
life
in
Paris
and
had
been
associated
with
Action
Fran
aise
123
Domestic
broadcasters
were
also
used
to
galvanise
support
for
occupation
in
Belgium
where
Ward
Hermans
regularly
spoke
in
support
of
the
Nazis
from
his
base
in
Bremen
124
and
the
Italian
Social
Republic
to
where
Giovanni
Preziosi
broadcast
a
vehemently
anti

his
base
in
Munich

126
127
Speakers
edit
The
Nazi
party
relied
heavily
on
speakers
to
make
its
propaganda
presentations
most
heavily
before
they
came
to
power
but
also
afterwards
Hitler
in
Mein
Kampf
recounted
that
he
had
realized
that
it
was
not
written
matter
but
the
spoken
word
that
brought
about
changes
as
people
would
not
read
things
that
disagreed
but
would
linger
to
hear
a
speaker
128
Furthermore
speakers
having
their
audiences
before
them
could
see
their
reactions
and
adjust
accordingly
to
persuade
129
His
own
oratory
was
a
major
factor
in
his
rise
and
he
despised
those
who
came
to
read
pre
written
speeches
130
Such
speakers
were
particularly
important
when
it
was
not
wanted
that
the
information
put
across
not
reach
foreigners
who
could
access
the
mass
media
131
Schools
were
instituted
to
substitute
for
the
political
conflict
that
had
formed
the
old
speakers
132
In
1939
Walter
Tiessler
de
speaking
of
his
own
experience
as
an
early
speaker
urged
that
they
continue
133
Sturmabteilung
speakers
were
used
though
their
reliance
on
instinct
sometimes
offended
well
educated
audiences
but
their
blunt
and
folksy
manner
often
had
its
own
appeal
134
The
ministry
would
provide
such
speakers
with
information
such
as
how
to
spin
the
problems
on
the
eastern
front
135
or
how
to
discuss
the
cuts
in
food
rations
136
The
party
propaganda
headquarters
sent
the
Redner
Schnellinformation
Speakers
Express
Information
out
with
guidelines
for
immediate
campaigns
such
as
anti
Semitic
campaigns
and
what
information
to
present
131
Specific
groups
were
targeted
with
such
speakers
Speakers
for
instance
were
created
specifically
for
Hitler
Youth
137
These
would
among
other
things
lecture
Hitler
Youth
and
the
BDM
on
the
need
to
produce
more
children
138
Speakers
often
addressed
political
or
military
rallies
which
were
well
orchestrated
events
with
banners
and
marching
bands

Themes
in
Nazi
propaganda
Nazi
propaganda
promoted
Nazi
ideology
by
demonizing
the
enemies
of
the
Nazi
Party
especially
Jews
and
communists
but
also
capitalists
and
intellectuals
The
campaign
against
Jews
was
especially
intensive
and
was
a
direct
result
of
Hitler
s
influence
on
Nazi
policy
Propaganda
also
promoted
the
values
asserted
by
the
Nazis
including
heroic
death
F
hrerprinzip
leader
principle
Volksgemeinschaft
people
s
community
Blut
und
Boden
blood
and
soil
and
the
youth
were
taught
early
to
take
pride
in
the
Germanic
master
race
Herrenvolk
Propaganda
was
also
used
to
maintain
the
cult
of
personality
around
Nazi
leader
Adolf
Hitler
and
to
promote
campaigns
for
eugenics
and
the
annexation
of
German
speaking
areas
After
the
outbreak
of
World
War
II
Nazi
propaganda
vilified
Germany
s
enemies
notably
the
United
Kingdom
the
Soviet
Union
and
the
United
States
and
exhorted
the
population
to
partake
in
total
war
Historiography
edit
Nazi
propaganda
is
a
relatively
recent
topic
of
close
study
140
Historians
of
all
persuasions
including
Eastern
Bloc
writers
agree
about
its
remarkable
effectiveness
140
Their
assessment
of
its
significance
however
whether
it
shaped
or
merely
directed
and
exploited
public
opinion
is
influenced
by
their
approach
to
wider
questions
raised
by
the
study
of
Nazi
Germany
such
as
the
question
whether
the
Nazi
state
was
a
fully
totalitarian
dictatorship
as
argued
by
Hannah
Arendt
or
whether
it
also
depended
on
a
certain
societal
consensus
141
In
addition
to
media
archives
an
important
primary
source
for
the
study
of
the
Nazi
propaganda
effort
are
the
reports
on
civilian
morale
and
public
opinion
that
the
Sicherheitsdienst
and
later
the
RMVP
compiled
from
1939
on
Another
are
the
Deutschland
Berichte
reports
gathered
by
underground
agents
of
the
Sopade
that
particularly
dealt
with
German
popular
opinion

was
a
German
film
director
producer

editor
photographer
actress
and
dancer
Born
in
1902
Leni
Riefenstahl
grew
up
in
Germany
with
her
brother
Heinz
1905
1944
who
was
killed
on
the
Eastern
Front
in
World
War
II
A
talented
swimmer
and
artist
she
also
became
interested
in
dancing
during
her
childhood
taking
dancing
lessons
and
performing
across
Europe
After
seeing
a
promotional
poster
for
the
1924
film
Der
Berg
des
Schicksals
The
Mountain
of
Destiny
Riefenstahl
was
inspired
to
move
into
acting
Between
1925
and
1929
she
starred
in
five
successful
motion
pictures
In
1932
Riefenstahl
decided
to
try
directing
with
her
own
film
called
Das
Blaue
Licht
The
Blue
Light
In
the
1930s
she
directed
Triumph
des
Willens
Triumph
of
the
Will
and
Olympia
resulting
in
worldwide
attention
and
acclaim
Both
movies
are
widely
considered
two
of
the
most
effective
and
technically
innovative
propaganda
films
ever
made
Her
involvement
in
Triumph
des
Willens
however
significantly
damaged
her
career
and
reputation
after
the
war
The
exact
nature
of
her
relationship
with
Nazi
Party
leader
Adolf
Hitler
remains
a
matter
of
debate
However
Hitler
was
in
close
collaboration
with
Riefenstahl
during
the
production
of
at
least
three
important
Nazi
films
and
a
closer
friendship
is
claimed
to
have
existed
2
When
in
2000
Jodie
Foster
was
planning
a
biographical
drama
on
Riefenstahl
war
crime
documenters
warned
against
a
revisionist
view
that
glorified
the
director
They
stated
that
publicly
Riefenstahl
seemed
quite
infatuated
with
Hitler
and
was
in
fact
the
last
surviving
member
of
his
inner
circle
3
Others
go
further
arguing
that
Riefenstahl
s
visions
were
essential
to
the
success
of
the
Holocaust
4
After
the
war
Riefenstahl
was
arrested
but
classified
as
being
a
fellow
traveler
or
Nazi
sympathiser
only
and
was
not
associated
with
war
crimes
Throughout
her
life
she
denied
having
known
about
the
Holocaust
Besides
directing
Riefenstahl
released
an
autobiography
and
wrote
several
books
on
the
Nuba
people
Riefenstahl
died
of
cancer
on
8
September
2003
at
the
age
of
101
and
was
buried
at
Munich

Early
life
edit
Helene
Bertha
Amalie
Riefenstahl
was
born
in
Germany
on
22
August
1902
5
Her
father
Alfred
Theodor
Paul
Riefenstahl
6
owned
a
successful
heating
and
ventilation
company
and
wanted
his
daughter
to
follow
him
into
the
business
world
7
Since
Riefenstahl
was
the
only
child
for
several
years
Alfred
wanted
her
to
carry
on
the
family
name
and
secure
the
family
fortune
7
However
her
mother
Bertha
Ida
Scherlach
who
had
been
a
part
time
seamstress
before
her
marriage
had
faith
in
Riefenstahl
and
believed
that
her
daughter
s
future
was
in
show
business
8
7
Riefenstahl
had
a
younger
brother
Heinz
who
was
killed
at
the
age
of
39
on
the
Eastern
Front
in
Nazi
Germany
s
war
against
the
Soviet
Union
9
Riefenstahl
fell
in
love
with
the
arts
in
her
childhood
10
She
began
to
paint
and
write
poetry
at
the
age
of
four
10
She
was
also
athletic
and
at
the
age
of
twelve
joined
a
gymnastics
and
swimming
club
7
Her
mother
was
confident
her
daughter
would
grow
up
to
be
successful
in
the
field
of
art
and
therefore
gave
her
full
support
unlike
Riefenstahl
s
father
who
was
not
interested
in
his
daughter
s
artistic
inclinations
7
In
1918
when
she
was
16
Riefenstahl
attended
a
presentation
of
Snow
White
which
interested
her
deeply
it
led
her
to
want
to
be
a
dancer
7
Her
father
instead
wanted
to
provide
his
daughter
with
an
education
that
could
lead
to
a
more
dignified
occupation
His
wife
however
continued
to
support
her
daughter
s
passion
7
Without
her
father
s
knowledge
she
enrolled
Riefenstahl
in
dance
and
ballet
classes
at
the
Grimm
Reiter
Dance
School
in
Berlin
where
she
quickly
became
a
star
pupil
7
Dancing
and
acting
careers
edit
Riefenstahl
attended
dancing
academies
and
became
well
known
for
her
self
styled
interpretive
dancing
skills
traveling
across
Europe
with
Max
Reinhardt
in
a
show
funded
by
Jewish
producer
Harry
Sokal
11
12
Riefenstahl
often
made
almost
700
Reichmarks
for
each
performance
and
was
so
dedicated
to
dancing
that
she
gave
filmmaking
no
thought
12
She
began
to
suffer
a
series
of
foot
injuries
that
led
to
knee
surgery
that
threatened
her
dancing
career
7
It
was
while
going
to
a
doctor
s
appointment
that
she
first
saw
a
poster
for
the
1924
film
Der
Berg
des
Schicksals
The
Mountain
of
Destiny
13
She
became
inspired
to
go
into
movie
making
and
began
visiting
the
cinema
to
see
films
and
also
attended
film
shows
7
On
one
of
her
adventures
Riefenstahl
met
Luis
Trenker
who
was
an
actor
from
Der
Berg
des
Schicksals
13
At
a
meeting
arranged
by
her
friend
Gunther
Rahn
she
met
Arnold
Fanck
the
director
of
Der
Berg
des
Schicksals
and
a
pioneer
of
the
mountain
film
genre
13
Fanck
was
working
on
a
film
in
Berlin
After
Riefenstahl
told
him
how
much
she
admired
his
work
she
also
convinced
him
of
her
acting
skill
13
She
persuaded
him
to
feature
her
in
one
of
his
movies
13
Riefenstahl
later
received
a
package
from
Fanck
containing
the
script
of
the
1926
film
Der
Heilige
Berg
The
Holy
Mountain
13
She
made
a
series
of
films
for
Fanck
where
she
learned
from
him
acting
and
film
editing
techniques
13
One
of
Fanck
s
films
that
brought
Riefenstahl
into
the
limelight
was
Die
Weisse
H
lle
vom
Piz
Pal
The
White
Hell
of
Piz
Pal
of
1929
co
directed
by
G
W
Pabst
13
Her
fame
spread
to
countries
outside
Germany
13
7
Riefenstahl
1933
in
SOS
Eisberg
Riefenstahl
produced
and
directed
her
own
work
called
Das
Blaue
Licht
The
Blue
Light
in
1932
co
written
by
Carl
Mayer
and
B
la
Bal
zs
14
This
film
won
the
Silver
Medal
at
the
Venice
Film
Festival
but
was
not
universally
well
received
for
which
Riefenstahl
blamed
the
critics
many
of
whom
were
Jewish
15
16
Upon
its
1938
re
release
the
names
of
Bal
zs
and
Sokal
both
Jewish
were
removed
from
the
credits
some
reports
claim
this
was
at
Riefenstahl
s
behest
15
In
the
film
Riefenstahl
played
an
innocent
peasant
girl
who
is
hated
by
the
villagers
because
they
think
she
is
diabolic
and
cast
out
13
She
is
protected
by
a
glowing
mountain
grotto
13
According
to
herself
Riefenstahl
received
invitations
to
travel
to
Hollywood
to
create
films
but
she
refused
them
in
favour
of
remaining
in
Germany
with
a
boyfriend
17
The
film
attracted
the
attention
of
Hitler
who
believed
she
epitomized
the
perfect
German
female
16
He
saw
talent
in
Riefenstahl
and
arranged
a
meeting
16
In
1933
Riefenstahl
appeared
in
the
U
S
German
co
productions
of
the
Arnold
Fanck
directed
German
language
SOS
Eisberg
and
the
Tay
Garnett
directed
English
language
SOS
Iceberg
The
movies
were
filmed
simultaneously
in
English
and
German
and
produced
and
distributed
by
Universal
Studios
Her
role
as
an
actress
in
SOS
Iceberg
was
her
only
English
language
role
in
film

Directing
career
edit
Propaganda

edit
Riefenstahl
stands
near
Heinrich
Himmler
while
instructing
her
camera
crew
at
Nuremberg
1934
Riefenstahl
heard
Nazi
Party
NSDAP
leader
Adolf
Hitler
speak
at
a
rally
in
1932
and
was
mesmerized
by
his
talent
as
a
public
speaker
2
Describing
the
experience
in
her
memoir
Riefenstahl
wrote
I
had
an
almost
apocalyptic
vision
that
I
was
never
able
to
forget
It
seemed
as
if
the
Earth
s
surface
were
spreading
out
in
front
of
me
like
a
hemisphere
that
suddenly
splits
apart
in
the
middle
spewing
out
an
enormous
jet
of
water
so
powerful
that
it
touched
the
sky
and
shook
the
earth
2
Riefenstahl
eventually
came
to
the
notice
of
Hitler
who
was
immediately
captivated
by
her
work
She
is
described
as
fitting
in
with
Hitler
s
ideal
of
Aryan
womanhood
a
feature
he
had
noted
when
he
saw
her
starring
performance
in
Das
Blaue
Licht
19
After
meeting
Hitler
Riefenstahl
was
offered
the
opportunity
to
direct
Der
Sieg
des
Glaubens
The
Victory
of
Faith
an
hour
long
propaganda
film
about
the
fifth
Nuremberg
Rally
in
1933
2
The
opportunity
that
was
offered
was
a
huge
surprise
to
Riefenstahl
Hitler
had
ordered
Goebbels
Propaganda
Ministry
to
give
the
film
commission
to
Riefenstahl
but
the
Ministry
had
never
informed
her
20
Riefenstahl
agreed
to
direct
the
movie
even
though
she
was
only
given
a
few
days
before
the
rally
to
prepare
20
She
and
Hitler
got
on
well
forming
a
friendly
relationship
2
The
propaganda
film
was
funded
entirely
by
the
NSDAP
2
During
the
filming
of
Victory
of
Faith
Hitler
had
stood
side
by
side
with
the
leader
of
the
Sturmabteilung
SA
Ernst
R
hm
a
man
with
whom
he
clearly
had
a
close
working
relationship
Rohm
was
ruthlessly
murdered
on
Hitler
s
orders
a
short
time
later
during
the
purge
of
the
SA
referred
to
as
the
Night
of
the
Long
Knives
It
has
gone
on
record
that
immediately
following
the
killings
Hitler
subsequently
ordered
all
copies
of
the
film
to
be
destroyed
although
Riefenstahl
disputes
that
this
ever
happened
21
Riefenstahl
and

camera
crew

front
of
Hitler
s
car
during
the
1934
rally
in
Nuremberg
Still
Impressed
with
Riefenstahl
s
work
Hitler
asked
her
to
film
Triumph
des
Willens
Triumph
of
the
Will
a
new
propaganda
film
about
the
1934
party
rally
in
Nuremberg
22
More
than
one
million
Germans
participated
in
the
rally
23
Initially
according
to
Riefenstahl
she
resisted
and
did
not
want
to
create
further
Nazi
Party
films
instead
wanting
to
direct
a
feature
film
based
on
Hitler
s
favourite
opera
Eugen
d
Albert
s
Tiefland
Lowlands
22
Riefenstahl
received
private
funding
for
the
production
of
Tiefland
but
the
filming
in
Spain
was
derailed
and
the
project
was
cancelled
22
Hitler
was
able
to
convince
her
to
film
Triumph
des
Willens
on
the
condition
that
she
would
not
be
required
to
make
further
films
for
the
party
according
to
Riefenstahl
24
The
motion
picture
was
generally
recognized
as
an
epic
innovative
work
of
propaganda
filmmaking
24
The
film
took
Riefenstahl
s
career
to
a
new
level
and
gave
her
further
international
recognition
25
In
interviews
for
the
1993
documentary
The
Wonderful
Horrible
Life
of
Leni
Riefenstahl
Riefenstahl
adamantly
denied
any
deliberate
attempt
to
create
Nazi
propaganda
and
said
she
was
disgusted
that
Triumph
des
Willens
was
used
in
such
a
way
17
Despite
allegedly
vowing
not
to
make
any
more
films
about
the
Nazi
Party
Riefenstahl
made
the
28
minute
Tag
der
Freiheit
Unsere
Wehrmacht
Day
of
Freedom
Our
Armed
Forces
about
the
German
Army
in
1935
26
Like
Der
Sieg
des
Glaubens
and
Triumph
des
Willens
this
was
filmed
at
the
annual
Nazi
Party
rally
at
Nuremberg
26
Riefenstahl
said
this
film
was
a
sub
set
of

added
to
mollify
the

felt
it

not
represented
well

27
Hitler
invited
Riefenstahl
to
film
the
1936
Summer
Olympics
scheduled
to
be
held
in
Berlin
a
film
which
Riefenstahl
claimed
had
been
commissioned
by
the
International
Olympic
Committee
28
She
visited
Greece
to
take
footage
of
the
route
of
the
inaugural
torch
relay
and
the
games
original
site
at
Olympia
where
she
was
aided
by
Greek
photographer
Nelly
s
28
This
material
became
Olympia
a
hugely
successful
film
which
has
since
been
widely
noted
for
its
technical
and
aesthetic
achievements
28
She
was
one
of
the
first
filmmakers
to
use
tracking
shots
in
a
documentary
29
placing
a
camera
on
rails
to
follow
the
athletes
movement
The
film
is
also
noted
for
its
slow
motion
shots
29
Riefenstahl
played
with
the
idea
of
slow
motion
underwater
diving
shots
extremely
high
and
low
shooting
angles
panoramic
aerial
shots
and
tracking
system
shots
for
allowing
fast
action
Many
of
these
shots
were
relatively
unheard
of
at
the
time
but
Leni
s
use
and
augmentation
of
them
set
a
standard
and
is
the
reason
why
they
are
still
used
to
this
day
30
Riefenstahl
s
work
on
Olympia
has
been
cited
as
a
major
influence
in
modern
sports
photography
28
29
Riefenstahl
filmed
competitors
of
all
races
including
African
American
Jesse
Owens
in
what
later
became
famous
footage
31
Riefenstahl
in
conversation
with
Propaganda
Minister
Joseph
Goebbels
1937
Olympia
premiered
for
Hitler
s
49th
birthday
in
1938
Its
international
debut
led
Riefenstahl
to
embark
on
an
American
publicity
tour
in
an
attempt
to
secure
commercial
release
32
In
February
1937
Riefenstahl
enthusiastically
told
a
reporter
for
the
Detroit
News
To
me
Hitler
is
the
greatest
man
who
ever
lived
He
truly
is
without
fault
so
simple
and
at
the
same
time
possessed
of
masculine
strength
33
She
arrived
in
New
York
City
on
4
November
1938
five
days
before
Kristallnacht
the
Night
of
the
Broken
Glass
34
When
news
of
the
event
reached
the
United
States
34
Riefenstahl
publicly
defended
Hitler
34
On
18
November
she
was
received
by
Henry
Ford
in
Detroit
Olympia
was
shown
at
the
Chicago
Engineers
Club
two
days
later
34
Avery
Brundage
President
of
the
International
Olympic
Committee
praised
the
film
and
held
Riefenstahl
in
the
highest
regard
35
She
negotiated
with
Louis
B
Mayer
and
on
8
December
Walt
Disney
brought
her
on
a
three
hour
tour
showing
her
the
ongoing
production
of
Fantasia
34
From
the
Goebbels
Diaries
researchers
learned
that
Riefenstahl
had
been
friendly
with
Joseph
Goebbels
and
his
wife
Magda
attending
the
opera
with
them
and
going
to
his
parties
33
Riefenstahl
maintained
that
Goebbels
was
upset
when
she
rejected
his
advances
and
was
jealous
of
her
influence
on
Hitler
seeing
her
as
an
internal
threat
15
She
therefore
insisted
his
diary
entries
could
not
be
trusted
15
By
later
accounts
Goebbels
thought
highly
of
Riefenstahl
s
filmmaking
but
was
angered
with
what
he
saw
as
her
overspending
on
the
Nazi
provided
filmmaking
budgets
15
World
War
II
edit
When
Germany
invaded
Poland
on
1
September
1939
Riefenstahl
was
photographed
in
Poland
wearing
a
military
uniform
and
a
pistol
on
her
belt
in
the
company
of
German
soldiers
she
had
gone
to
Poland
as
a
war
correspondent
36
15
On
12
September
she
was
in
the
town
of
Ko
skie
when
30
civilians
were
executed
in
retaliation
for
an
alleged
attack
on
German
soldiers
37
According
to
her
memoir
Riefenstahl
tried
to
intervene
but
a
furious
German
soldier
held
her
at
gunpoint
and
threatened
to
shoot
her
on
the
spot
15
She
claimed
she
did
not
realize
the
victims
were
Jews
15
Closeup
photographs
of
a
distraught
Riefenstahl
survive
from
that
day
15
Nevertheless
by
5
October
1939
Riefenstahl
was
back
in
occupied
Poland
filming
Hitler
s
victory
parade
in
Warsaw
37
Afterwards
she
left
Poland
and
chose
not
to
make
any
more
Nazi
related
movies
38
Riefenstahl
as
a
war
correspondent
in
Poland
1939
On
14
June
1940
the
day
Paris
was
declared
an
open
city
by
the
French
and
occupied
by
German
troops
Riefenstahl
wrote
to
Hitler
in
a
telegram
With
indescribable
joy
deeply
moved
and
filled
with
burning
gratitude
we
share
with
you
my
F
hrer
your
and
Germany
s
greatest
victory
the
entry
of
German
troops
into
Paris
You
exceed
anything
human
imagination
has
the
power
to
conceive
achieving
deeds
without
parallel
in
the
history
of
mankind
How
can
we
ever
thank
you
37
She
later
explained
Everyone
thought
the
war
was
over
and
in
that
spirit
I
sent
the
cable
to
Hitler
39
Riefenstahl
was
friends
with
Hitler
for
12
years
and
reports
vary
as
to
whether
she
ever
had
an
intimate
relationship
with
him
40
Her
relationship
with
Hitler
severely
declined
in
1944
after
her
brother
died
on
the
Russian
Front
38
After
the
Nuremberg
rallies
trilogy
and
Olympia
Riefenstahl
began
work
on
the
movie
she
had
tried
and
failed
to
direct
once
before
namely
Tiefland
41
8
On
Hitler
s
direct
order
the
German
government
paid
her
seven
million
Reichsmarks
in
compensation
42
From
23
September
until
13
November
1940
she
filmed
in
Kr
n
near
Mittenwald
41
The
extras
playing
Spanish
women
and
farmers
were
drawn
from
gypsies
detained
in
a
camp
at
Salzburg
Maxglan
who
were
forced
to
work
with
her
41
Filming
at
the
Babelsberg
Studios
near
Berlin
began
18
months
later
in
April
1942
41
This
time
Sinti
and
Roma
people
from
the
Marzahn
detention
camp
near
Berlin
were
compelled
to
work
as
extras
41
Almost
to
the
end
of
her
life
despite
overwhelming
evidence
that
the
concentration
camp
occupants
had
been
forced
to
work
on
the
movie
unpaid
Riefenstahl
continued
to
maintain
all
the
film
extras
survived
and
that
she
had
met
several
of
them
after
the
war
43
40
Riefenstahl
sued
filmmaker
Nina
Gladitz
who
said
Riefenstahl
personally
chose
the
extras
at
their
holding
camp
Gladitz
had
found
one
of
the
Gypsy
survivors
and
matched
his
memory
with
stills
of
the
movie
for
a
documentary
Gladitz
was
filming
44
The
German
court
ruled
largely
in
favour
of
Gladitz
declaring
that
Riefenstahl
had
known
the
extras
were
from
a
concentration
camp
but
they
also
agreed
that
Riefenstahl
had
not
been
informed
the
Gypsies
would
be
sent
to
Auschwitz
after
filming
was
completed
44
Riefenstahl
instructing
her
film
crew
in
Poland
1939
This
issue
came
up
again
in
2002
when
Riefenstahl
was
one
hundred
years
old
and
she
was
taken
to
court
by
a
Roma
group
for
denying
the
Nazis
had
exterminated
gypsies
45
Riefenstahl
apologized
and
said
I
regret
that
Sinti
and
Roma
people
had
to
suffer
during
the
period
of
National
Socialism
It
is
known
today
that
many
of
them
were
murdered
in
concentration
camps
45
In
October
1944
the
production
of
Tiefland
moved
to
Barrandov
Studios
in
Prague
for
interior
filming
7
Lavish
sets
made
these
shots
some
of
the
most
costly
of
the
film
7
The
film
was
not
edited
and
released
until
almost
ten
years
later
7
The
last
time
Riefenstahl
saw
Hitler
was
when
she
married
Peter
Jacob
on
21
March
1944
39
Riefenstahl
and
Jacob
divorced
in
1946
46
As
Germany
s
military
situation
became
impossible
by
early
1945
Riefenstahl
left
Berlin
and
was
hitchhiking
with
a
group
of
men
trying
to
reach
her
mother
when
she
was
taken
into
custody
by
American
troops
7
She
walked
out
of
a
holding
camp
beginning
a
series
of
escapes
and
arrests
across
the
chaotic
landscape
7
At
last
making
it
back
home
on
a
bicycle
she
found
that
American
troops
had
seized
her
house
7
She
was
surprised
by
how
kindly
they
treated
her
7
Thwarted
film
projects
edit
Most
of
Riefenstahl
s
unfinished
projects
were
lost
towards
the
end
of
the
war
7
The
French
government
confiscated
all
of
her
editing
equipment
along
with
the
production
reels
of
Tiefland
7
After
years
of
legal
wrangling
these
were
returned
to
her
but
the
French
government
had
reportedly
damaged
some
of
the
film
stock
whilst
trying
to
develop
and
edit
it
with
a
few
key
scenes
being
missing
although
Riefenstahl
was
surprised
to
find
the
original
negatives
for
Olympia
in
the
same
shipment
7
She
edited
and
dubbed
the
remaining
material
and
Tiefland
premiered
on
11
February
1954
in
Stuttgart
7
However
it
was
denied
entry
into
the
Cannes
Film
Festival
7
Although
Riefenstahl
lived
for
almost
another
half
century
Tiefland
was
her
last
feature
film
47
Riefenstahl
filming
a
difficult
scene
with
the
help
of
two
assistants
1936
Riefenstahl
tried
many
times
to
make
more
films
during
the
1950s
and
1960s
but
was
met
with
resistance
public
protests
and
sharp
criticism
7
Many
of
her
filmmaking
peers
in
Hollywood
had
fled
Nazi
Germany
and
were
unsympathetic
to
her
7
Although
both
film
professionals
and
investors
were
willing
to
support
her
work
most
of
the
projects
she
attempted
were
stopped
owing
to
ever
renewed
and
highly
negative
publicity
about
her
past
work
for
the
Third
Reich
7
In
1954
Jean
Cocteau
who
greatly
admired
the
film
insisted
on
Tiefland
being
shown
at
the
Cannes
Film
Festival
which
he
was
running
that
year
11
In
1960
Riefenstahl
attempted
to
prevent
filmmaker
Erwin
Leiser
from
juxtaposing
scenes
from
Triumph
des
Willens
with
footage
from
concentration
camps
in
his
film
Mein
Kampf
11
Riefenstahl
had
high
hopes
for
a
collaboration
with
Cocteau
called
Friedrich
und
Voltaire
Friedrich
and
Voltaire
wherein
Cocteau
was
to
play
two
roles
48
They
thought
the
film
might
symbolize
the
love
hate
relationship
between
Germany
and
France
48
Cocteau
s
illness
and
1963
death
put
an
end
to
the
project
48
A
musical
remake
of
Das
Blaue
Licht
The
Blue
Light
with
an
English
production
company
also
fell
apart
49
In
the
1960s
Riefenstahl
became
interested
in
Africa
from
Ernest
Hemingway
s
Green
Hills
of
Africa
and
from
the
photographs
of
George
Rodger
50
38
She
visited
Kenya
for
the
first
time
in
1956
and
later
Sudan
where
she
photographed
Nuba
tribes
with
whom
she
sporadically
lived
learning
about
their
culture
so
she
could
photograph
them
more
easily
50
Even
though
her
film
project
about
modern
slavery
entitled
Die
Schwarze
Fracht
The
Black
Cargo
was
never
completed
Riefenstahl
was
able
to
sell
the
stills
from
the
expedition
to
magazines
in
various
parts
of
the
world
50
While
scouting
shooting
locations
she
almost
died
from
injuries
received
in
a
truck
accident
7
After
waking
up
from
a
coma
in
a
Nairobi
hospital
she
finished
writing
the
script
but
was
soon
thoroughly
thwarted
by
uncooperative
locals
the
Suez
Canal
crisis
and
bad
weather
7
In
the
end
the
film
project
was
called
off
7
Even
so
Riefenstahl
was
granted
Sudanese
citizenship
for
her
services
to
the
country
becoming
the
first
foreigner
to
receive
a
Sudanese
passport

assigned
by

Navy
to
the
OSS
for
intelligence
work
while
attached
to
John
Ford
s
documentary
unit
was
ordered
to
arrest
Riefenstahl
at
her
chalet
in
Kitzb
hel
ostensibly
to
have
her
identify
Nazi
war
criminals
in
German
film
footage
captured
by
the
Allied
troops
shortly
after
the
war
52
Riefenstahl
claimed
she
was
not
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
internment
camps
53
According
to
Schulberg
She
gave
me
the
usual
song
and
dance
She
said
Of
course
you
know
I
m
really
so
misunderstood
I
m
not
political
53
Riefenstahl
claimed
she
was
fascinated
by
the
Nazis
but
also
politically
naive
remaining
ignorant
about
war
crimes
54
Throughout
1945
to
1948
she
was
held
by
various
Allied
controlled
prison
camps
across
Germany
54
She
was
also
under
house
arrest
for
a
period
of
time
54
She
was
tried
four
times
by
postwar
authorities
for
denazification
and
eventually
found
to
be
a
fellow
traveler
Mitl
ufer
who
sympathised
with
the
Nazis
54
Riefenstahl
said
that
her
biggest
regret
in
life
was
meeting
Hitler
declaring
It
was
the
biggest
catastrophe
of
my
life
Until
the
day
I
die
people
will
keep
saying
Leni
is
a
Nazi
and
I
ll
keep
saying
But
what
did
she
do
54
Even
though
she
went
on
to
win
up
to
50
libel
cases
details
about
her
relation
to
the
Nazi
party
generally
remain
unclear
54
Shortly
before
she
died
Riefenstahl
voiced
her
final
words
on
the
subject
of
her
connection
to
Adolf
Hitler
in
a
BBC
interview
I
was
one
of
millions
who
thought
Hitler
had
all
the
answers
We
saw
only
the
good
things
we
didn

know
bad

final
film

Riefenstahl
began
a
lifelong
companionship
with
her
cameraman
Horst
Kettner
who
was
40
years
her
junior
and
assisted
her
with
the
photographs
they
were
together

the
time
she
was
60
and
he

20
56
Riefenstahl
s
books
with
photographs
of
the
Nuba

as
Die
Nuba
translated
as
The
Last

and
Die
Nuba
von

The
Nuba
People
of

While
heralded
by
many
as
outstanding
colour
photographs
they
were
harshly
criticized
by
Susan
Sontag
who
claimed
in
a
review
that
they
were
further
evidence
of
Riefenstahl
s
fascist
aesthetics
57
The
Art
Director
s
Club
of
Germany
awarded
Riefenstahl
a
gold
medal
for
the
best

of
1975

She
also
sold
some
of
the
pictures
to

In

90s
Riefenstahl
was
still

gained
the
distinction
of
being
one
of
the
world
s

at

in
P

67
After
her
death
there

Reception
edit
Film
scholar
Mark
Cousins
notes
in
his
book
The
Story
of
Film
that
Next
to
Orson
Welles
and
Alfred
Hitchcock
Leni
Riefenstahl
was
the
most
technically
talented
Western
film
maker
of
her
era
68
Reviewer
Gary
Morris
called
Riefenstahl
An
artist
of
unparalleled
gifts
a
woman
in
an
industry
dominated
by
men
one
of
the
great
formalists
of
the
cinema
on
a
par
with
Eisenstein
or
Welles
69
Riefenstahl
on
the
cover
of
Time
1936
Film
critic
Hal
Erickson
of
the
New
York
Times
states
that
the
Jewish
Question
is
mainly
unmentioned
in
Triumph
des
Willens
filmmaker
Leni
Riefenstahl
prefers
to
concentrate
on
cheering
crowds
precision
marching
military
bands
and
Hitler
s
climactic
speech
all
orchestrated
choreographed
and
illuminated
on
a
scale
that
makes
Griffith
and
DeMille
look
like
poverty
row
directors
70
Charles
Moore
of
The
Daily
Telegraph
wrote
She
was
perhaps
the
most
talented
female
cinema
director
of
the
20th
century
her
celebration
of
Nazi
Germany
in
film
ensured
that
she
was
certainly
the
most
infamous
38
Film
journalist
Sandra
Smith
from
The
Independent
remarked
Opinions
will
be
divided
between
those
who
see
her
as
a
young
talented
and
ambitious
woman
caught
up
in
the
tide
of
events
which
she
did
not
fully
understand
and
those
who
believe
her
to
be
a
cold
and
opportunist
propagandist
and
a
Nazi
by
association
71
Critic
Judith
Thurman
said
in
The
New
Yorker
that
Riefenstahl
s
genius
has
rarely
been
questioned
even
by
critics
who
despise
the
service
to
which
she
lent
it
Riefenstahl
was
a
consummate
stylist
obsessed
with
bodies
in
motion
particularly
those
of
dancers
and
athletes
Riefenstahl
relies
heavily
for
her
transitions
on
portentous
cutaways
to
clouds
mist
statuary
foliage
and
rooftops
Her
reaction
shots
have
a
tedious
sameness
shining
ecstatic
faces
nearly
all
young
and
Aryan
except
for
Hitler
s
72
Pauline
Kael
also
a
film
reviewer
employed
for
The
New
Yorker
called
Triumph
des
Willens
and
Olympia
the
two
greatest
films
ever
directed
by
a
woman
56
Writer
Richard
Corliss
wrote
in
Time
that
he
was
impressed
by
Riefenstahl
s
standing
as
a
total
auteur
producer
writer
director
editor
and
in
the
fiction
films
actress
The
issues
her
films
and
her
career
raise
are
as
complex
and
they
are
important
and
her
vilifiers
tend
to
reduce
the
argument
to
one
of
a
director
s
complicity
in
atrocity
or
her
criminal
ignorance
56
Film
biographies
edit
In
1993
Riefenstahl
was
the
subject
of
the
award
winning
German
documentary
film
The
Wonderful
Horrible
Life
of
Leni
Riefenstahl
directed
by
Ray
M
ller
73
Riefenstahl
appeared
in
the
film
and
answered
several
questions
and
detailed
the
production
of
her
films
73
74
The
biofilm
was
nominated
for
seven
Emmy
Awards
winning
in
one
category
73
Riefenstahl
who
for
some
time
had
been
working
on
her
memoirs
decided
to
cooperate
in
the
production
of
this
documentary
to
tell
her
life
story
about
the
struggles
she
had
gone
through
in
her
personal
life
her
film
making
career
and
what
people
thought
of
her
74
She
was
also
the
subject
of
M
ller
s
2000
documentary
film
Leni
Riefenstahl
Her
Dream
of
Africa
about
her
return
to
Sudan
to
visit
the
Nuba
people
63
In
April
2007
The
Guardian
reported
that
British
screenwriter
Rupert
Walters
was
writing
a
movie
based
on
Riefenstahl
s
life
which
would
star
actress
Jodie
Foster
37
The
project
did
not
receive
Riefenstahl
s
approval
prior
to
her
death
as
Riefenstahl
asked
for
a
veto
on
any
scenes
to
which
she
did
not
agree
37
Riefenstahl
also
wanted
Sharon
Stone
to
play
her
rather
than
Foster
which
ultimately
resulted
in
the
cancellation
of
the
project
37
In
2011
director
Steven
Soderbergh
revealed
that
he
had
also
been
working
on
a
biopic
of
Riefenstahl
for
about
six
months
75
He
eventually
abandoned
the
project
over
concerns
of
its
commercial
prospects
75
In
popular
culture
edit
Riefenstahl
s
filming
merits
are
discussed
between
characters
in
the
2009
Quentin
Tarantino
film
Inglourious
Basterds
76
Riefenstahl
was
portrayed
by
Zdena
Studenkov
in
Leni
a
2014
Slovak
drama
play
about
her
fictional
participation
in
The
Tonight
Show
Starring
Johnny
Carson
77
Riefenstahl
was
portrayed
by
Dutch
actress
Carice
van
Houten
in
Race
a
sports
drama
film
directed
by
Stephen
Hopkins
about
Jesse
Owens
It
was
released
in
North
America
on
February
19
2016
78
To
make
her
sympathetic
portrayal
acceptable
to
an
American
audience
the
film
dramatizes
her
quarrels
with
Goebbels
over
her
direction
of
the
film
Olympia
especially
about
filming
the
African
American
star
who
is
proving
to
be
a
politically
embarrassing
refutation
of
Nazi
Germany
s
claims
of
Aryan
athletic
supremacy
Riefenstahl
was
referred
to
in
the
series
finale
of
the
television
show
Weeds
when
Nancy
questions
Andy
for
naming
his
daughter
after
a
Nazi
to
which
he
replied
she
was
a
pioneer
in
film
making
I

Applied
mathematics
is
a
branch
of
mathematics
that
deals
with
mathematical
methods
that
find
use
in
science
engineering
business
computer
science
and
industry
Thus
applied
mathematics
is
a
combination
of
mathematical
science
and
specialized
knowledge
The
term
applied
mathematics
also
describes
the
professional
specialty
in
which
mathematicians
work
on
practical
problems
by
formulating
and
studying
mathematical
models
In
the
past
practical
applications
have
motivated
the
development
of
mathematical
theories
which
then
became
the
subject
of
study
in
pure
mathematics
where
abstract
concepts
are
studied
for
their
own
sake
The
activity
of
applied
mathematics
is
thus
intimately
connected
with
research
in
pure
mathematics

History
edit
A
numerical

the
heat
equation
on
a
pump
casing
model
using
the
finite
element
method
Historically
applied
mathematics
consisted
principally
of
applied
analysis
most
notably
differential
equations
approximation
theory
broadly
construed
to
include
representations
asymptotic
methods
variational
methods
and
numerical
analysis
and
applied
probability
These
areas
of
mathematics
related
directly
to
the
development
of
Newtonian
physics
and
in
fact
the
distinction
between
mathematicians
and
physicists
was
not
sharply
drawn
before
the
mid
19th
century
This
history
left
a
pedagogical
legacy
in
the
United
States
until
the
early
20th
century
subjects
such
as
classical
mechanics
were
often
taught
in
applied
mathematics
departments
at
American
universities
rather
than
in
physics
departments
and
fluid
mechanics
may
still
be
taught
in
applied
mathematics
departments

Quantitative
finance
is
now
taught
in
mathematics
departments
across
universities
and
mathematical
finance
is
considered
a
full
branch
of
applied
mathematics
2
Engineering
and
computer
science
departments
have
traditionally
made
use
of
applied
mathematics
Divisions
edit
Fluid
mechanics
is
often
considered
a
branch
of
applied
mathematics
and
mechanical
engineering
Today
the
term
applied
mathematics
is
used
in
a
broader
sense
It
includes
the
classical
areas
noted
above
as
well
as
other
areas
that
have
become
increasingly
important
in
applications
Even
fields
such
as
number
theory
that
are
part
of
pure
mathematics
are
now
important
in
applications
such
as
cryptography
though
they
are
not
generally
considered
to
be
part
of
the
field
of
applied
mathematics
per
se
Sometimes
the
term
applicable
mathematics
is
used
to
distinguish
between
the
traditional
applied
mathematics
that
developed
alongside
physics
and
the
many
areas
of
mathematics
that
are
applicable
to
real
world
problems
today
There
is
no
consensus
as
to
what
the
various
branches
of
applied
mathematics
are
Such
categorizations
are
made
difficult
by
the
way
mathematics
and
science
change
over
time
and
also
by
the
way
universities
organize
departments
courses
and
degrees
Many
mathematicians
distinguish
between
applied
mathematics
which
is
concerned
with
mathematical
methods
and
the
applications
of
mathematics
within
science
and
engineering
A
biologist
using
a
population
model
and
applying
known
mathematics
would
not
be
doing
applied
mathematics
but
rather
using
it
however
mathematical
biologists
have
posed
problems
that
have
stimulated
the
growth
of
pure
mathematics
Mathematicians
such
as
Poincar
and
Arnold
deny
the
existence
of
applied
mathematics
and
claim
that
there
are
only
applications
of
mathematics
Similarly
non
mathematicians
blend
applied
mathematics
and
applications
of
mathematics
The
use
and
development
of
mathematics
to
solve
industrial
problems
is
also
called
industrial
mathematics
3
The
success
of
modern
numerical
mathematical
methods
and
software
has
led
to
the
emergence
of
computational
mathematics
computational
science
and
computational
engineering
which
use
high
performance
computing
for
the
simulation
of
phenomena
and
the
solution
of
problems
in
the
sciences
and
engineering
These
are
often
considered
interdisciplinary
Utility
edit
Mathematical
finance
is
concerned
with
the
modelling
of
financial
markets
Historically
mathematics
was
most
important
in
the
natural
sciences
and
engineering
However
since
World
War
II
fields
outside
the
physical
sciences
have
spawned
the
creation
of
new
areas
of
mathematics
such
as
game
theory
and
social
choice
theory
which
grew
out
of
economic
considerations
The
advent
of
the
computer
has
enabled
new
applications
studying
and
using
the
new
computer
technology
itself
computer
science
to
study
problems
arising
in
other
areas
of
science
computational
science
as
well
as
the
mathematics
of
computation
for
example
theoretical
computer
science
computer
algebra
numerical
analysis
Statistics
is
probably
the
most
widespread
mathematical
science
used
in
the
social
sciences
but
other
areas
of
mathematics
most
notably
economics
are
proving
increasingly
useful
in
these
disciplines
Status
in
academic
departments
edit
Academic
institutions
are
not
consistent
in
the
way
they
group
and
label
courses
programs
and
degrees
in
applied
mathematics
At
some
schools
there
is
a
single
mathematics
department
whereas
others
have
separate
departments
for
Applied
Mathematics
and
Pure
Mathematics
It
is
very
common
for
Statistics
departments
to
be
separated
at
schools
with
graduate
programs
but
many
undergraduate
only
institutions
include
statistics
under
the
mathematics
department
Many
applied
mathematics
programs
as
opposed
to
departments
consist
of
primarily
cross
listed
courses
and
jointly
appointed
faculty
in
departments
representing
applications
Some
Ph
D
programs
in
applied
mathematics
require
little
or
no
coursework
outside
mathematics
while
others
require
substantial
coursework
in
a
specific
area
of
application
In
some
respects
this
difference
reflects
the
distinction
between
application
of
mathematics
and
applied
mathematics
Some
universities
in
the
UK
host
departments
of
Applied
Mathematics
and
Theoretical
Physics

but
it
is
now
much
less
common
to
have
separate
departments
of

exception
to
this
is
the
Department
of
Applied

economics
The
applied
methods
usually
refer
to
nontrivial
mathematical
techniques
or
approaches
Mathematical
economics
is
based
on
statistics
probability
mathematical
programming
as
well
as
other
computational
methods
operations
research
game
theory
and
some
methods
from
mathematical
analysis
In
this
regard
it
resembles
but
is
distinct
from
financial
mathematics
another
part
of
applied
mathematics
According
to
the
Mathematics
Subject
Classification
MSC
mathematical
economics
falls
into
the

The
line
between
applied
mathematics
and
specific
areas
of
application
is
often
blurred
Many
universities
teach
mathematical

Triumph
of

German
Triumph
des
Willens
is
a
1935
German
propaganda
film
directed
produced
edited
and
co
written
by
Leni
Riefenstahl
It
chronicles
the
1934
Nazi
Party
Congress
in
Nuremberg
which
was
attended
by
more
than
700
000
Nazi
supporters
1
The
film
contains
excerpts
from
speeches
given
by
Nazi
leaders
at
the
Congress
including
Adolf
Hitler
Rudolf
Hess
and
Julius
Streicher
interspersed
with
footage
of
massed
Sturmabteilung
SA
and
Schutzstaffel
SS
troops
and
public
reaction
Hitler
commissioned
the
film
and
served
as
an
unofficial
executive
producer
his
name
appears
in
the
opening
titles
The
film
s
overriding
theme
is
the
return
of
Germany
as
a
great
power
with
Hitler
as
the
leader
who
will
bring
glory
to
the
nation
Because
the
film
was
made
after
the
1934
Night
of
the
Long
Knives
on
30
June
many
prominent
Sturmabteilung
SA
members
are
absent
they
were
murdered
in
that
Party
purge
organised
and
orchestrated
by
Hitler
to
replace
the
SA
with
the
Schutzstaffel
SS
as
his
main
paramilitary
force
Triumph
of
the
Will
was
released
in
1935
and
became
a
prominent
example
of
propaganda
in
film
history
Riefenstahl
s
techniques
such
as
moving
cameras
aerial
photography
the
use
of
long
focus
lenses
to
create
a
distorted
perspective
and
the
revolutionary
approach
to
the
use
of
music
and
cinematography
have
earned
Triumph
of
the
Will
recognition
as
one
of
the
greatest
propaganda
films
in
history
Riefenstahl
helped
to
stage
the
scenes
directing
and
rehearsing
some
of
them
at
least
fifty
times
Riefenstahl
won
several
awards
not
only
in
Germany
but
also
in
the
United
States
France
Sweden
and
other
countries
The
film
was
popular
in
the
Third
Reich
and
has
continued
to
influence
films
documentaries
and
commercials
to
this
day
2
In
Germany
the
film
is
not
censored
but
the
courts
commonly
classify
it
as
Nazi
propaganda
which
requires
an
educational
context
to
public
screenings
3
An
earlier
film
by
Riefenstahl
The
Victory
of
Faith
Der
Sieg
des
Glaubens
showed
Hitler
and
SA
leader
Ernst
R
hm
together
at
the
1933
Nazi
party
congress
After
R
hm
s
murder
the
party
attempted
the
destruction
of
all
copies
leaving
only
one
known
to
have
survived
in
Britain
The
direction
and
sequencing
of
images
is
almost
the
same
as
that
Riefenstahl
used
in
Triumph
of
the
Will
a
year
later
Frank
Capra
s
seven
film
series
Why
We
Fight
is
said
to
have
been
directly
inspired
by
and
the
United
States
response
to
Triumph
of
the
Will

Getreuen
Adolf
Hitler
flew
again
to
Nuremberg
to
review
the
columns
of
his
faithful
followers
Day
1
The
film
opens
with
shots
of
the
clouds
above
the
city
and
then
moves
through
the
clouds
to
float
above
the
assembling
masses
below
with
the
intention
of
portraying
beauty
and
majesty
of
the
scene
The
cruciform
shadow
of
Hitler
s
plane
is
visible
as
it
passes
over
the
tiny
figures
marching
below
accompanied
by
an
orchestral
arrangement
of
the
Horst
Wessel
Lied
Upon
arriving
at
the
Nuremberg
airport
Hitler
and
other
Nazi
leaders
emerge
from
his
plane
to
thunderous
applause
and
a
cheering
crowd
He
is
then
driven
into
Nuremberg
through
equally
enthusiastic
people
to
his
hotel
where
a
night
rally
is
later
held
Day
2
The
second
day
begins
with
images
of
Nuremberg
at
dawn
accompanied
by
an
extract
from
the
Act
III
Prelude
Wach
Auf
of
Richard
Wagner
s
Die
Meistersinger
von
N
rnberg
Following
this
is
a
montage
of
the
attendees
preparing
for
the
opening
of
the
Reich
Party
Congress
and
footage
of
the
top
Nazi
officials
arriving
at
the
Luitpold
Arena
The
film
then
cuts
to
the
opening
ceremony
where
Rudolf
Hess
announces
the
start
of
the
Congress
The
camera
then
introduces
much
of
the
Nazi
hierarchy
and
covers
their
opening
speeches
including
Joseph
Goebbels
Alfred
Rosenberg
Hans
Frank
Fritz
Todt
Robert
Ley
and
Julius
Streicher
Then
the
film
cuts
to
an
outdoor
rally
for
the
Reichsarbeitsdienst
Labor
Service
which
is
primarily
a
series
of
quasi
military
drills
by
men
carrying
spades
This
is
also
where
Hitler
gives
his
first
speech
on
the
merits
of
the
Labour
Service
and
praising
them
for
their
work
in
rebuilding
Germany
The
day
then
ends
with
a
torchlight
SA
parade
in
which
Viktor
Lutze
speaks
to
the
crowds
Day
3
The
third
day
starts
with
a
Hitler
Youth
rally
on
the
parade
ground
Again
the
camera
covers
the
Nazi
dignitaries
arriving
and
the
introduction
of
Hitler
by
Baldur
von
Schirach
Hitler
then
addresses
the
Youth
describing
in
militaristic
terms
how
they
must
harden
themselves
and
prepare
for
sacrifice
Everyone
present
including
General
Werner
von
Blomberg
then
assemble
for
a
military
pass
and
review
featuring
Wehrmacht
cavalry
and
various
armored
vehicles
That
night
Hitler
delivers
another
speech
to
low
ranking
party
officials
by
torchlight
commemorating
the
first
year
since
the
Nazis
took
power
and
declaring
that
the
party
and
state
are
one
entity
Day
4
The
fourth
day
is
the
climax
of
the
film
where
the
most
memorable
of
the
imagery
is
presented
Hitler
flanked
by
Heinrich
Himmler
and
Viktor
Lutze
walks
through
a
long
wide
expanse
with
over
150
000
SA
and
SS
troops
standing
at
attention
to
lay
a
wreath
at
a
First
World
War
memorial
Hitler
then
reviews
the
parading
SA
and
SS
men
following
which
Hitler
and
Lutze
deliver
a
speech
where
they
discuss
the
Night
of
the
Long
Knives
purge
of
the
SA
several
months
prior
Lutze
reaffirms
the
SA
s
loyalty
to
the
regime
and
Hitler
absolves
the
SA
of
any
crimes
committed
by
Ernst
R
hm
New
party
flags
are
consecrated
by
letting
them
touch
the
Blutfahne
the
same
cloth
flag
said
to
have
been
carried
by
the
fallen
Nazis
during
the
Beer
Hall
Putsch
and
following
a
final
parade
in
front
of
the
Nuremberg
Frauenkirche
Hitler
delivers
his
closing
speech
In
it
he
reaffirms
the
primacy
of
the
Nazi
Party
in
Germany
declaring
All
loyal
Germans
will
become
National
Socialists
Only
the
best
National
Socialists
are
party
comrades
Hess
then
leads
the
assembled
crowd
in
a
final
Sieg
Heil
salute
for
Hitler
marking
the
close
of
the
party
congress
The
entire
crowd
sings
the
Horst
Wessel
Lied
as
the
camera
focuses
on
the
giant
Swastika
banner
which
fades
into
a
line
of
silhouetted
men
in
Nazi
party
uniforms
marching
in
formation
as
the
lyrics
Comrades
shot
by
the
Red
Front
and
the
Reactionaries
march
in
spirit
together
in
our
columns
are
sung
Origins
edit
Shortly
after
he
came
to
power
Hitler
called
me
to
see
him
and
explained
that
he
wanted
a
film
about
a
Party
Congress
and
wanted
me
to
make
it
My
first
reaction
was
to
say
that
I
did
not
know
anything
about
the
way
such
a
thing
worked
or
the
organisation
of
the
Party
so
that
I
would
obviously
photograph
all
the
wrong
things
and
please
nobody
even
supposing
that
I
could
make
a
documentary
which
I
had
never
yet
done
Hitler
said
that
this
was
exactly
why
he
wanted
me
to
do
it
because
anyone
who
knew
all
about
the
relative
importance
of
the
various
people
and
groups
and
so
on
might
make
a
film
that
would
be
pedantically
accurate
but
this
was
not
what
he
wanted
He
wanted
a
film
showing
the
Congress
through
a
non
expert
eye
selecting
just
what
was
most
artistically
satisfying
in
terms
of
spectacle
I
suppose
you
might
say
He
wanted
a
film
which
would
move
appeal
to
impress
an
audience
which
was
not
necessarily
interested
in
politics
Leni
Riefenstahl
Riefenstahl
a
popular
German
actress
had
directed
her
first
film
called
Das
blaue
Licht
The
Blue
Light
in
1932
Around
the
same
time
she
first
heard
Hitler
speak
at
a
Nazi
rally
and
by
her
own
admission
was
impressed
She
later
began
a
correspondence
with
him
that
would
last
for
years
Hitler
by
turn
was
equally
impressed
with
Das
blaue
Licht
and
in
1933
asked
her
to
direct
a
film
about
the
Nazis
annual
Nuremberg
Rally
The
Nazis
had
only
recently
taken
power
amid
a
period
of
political
instability
Hitler
was
the
fourth
Chancellor
of
Germany
in
less
than
a
year
and
were
considered
an
unknown
quantity
by
many
Germans
to
say
nothing
of
the
world
In
Mein
Kampf
5
Hitler
talks
of
the
success
of
British
propaganda
in
World
War
I
believing
people
s
ignorance
meant
simple
repetition
and
an
appeal
to
feelings
over
reason
would
suffice
6
Hitler
chose
Riefenstahl
as
he
wanted
the
film
as
artistically
satisfying
7
as
possible
to
appeal
to
a
non
political
audience
but
he
also
believed
that
propaganda
must
admit
no
element
of
doubt
5
As
such
Triumph
of
the
Will
may
be
seen
as
a
continuation
of
the
unambiguous
World
War
I
style
propaganda
though
heightened
by
the
film
s
artistic
or
poetic
nature
Riefenstahl
was
initially
reluctant
not
because
of
any
moral
qualms
but
because
she
wanted
to
continue
making
feature
films
citation
needed
Hitler
persisted
and
Riefenstahl
eventually
agreed
to
make
a
film
at
the
1933
Nuremberg
Rally
called
Der
Sieg
des
Glaubens
Victory
of
Faith
However
the
film
had
numerous
technical
problems
including
a
lack
of
preparation
Riefenstahl
reported
having
just
a
few
days
and
Hitler
s
apparent
unease
at
being
filmed
To
make
matters
worse
Riefenstahl
had
to
deal
with
infighting
by
party
officials
in
particular
Joseph
Goebbels
who
tried
to
have
the
film
released
by
the
Propaganda
Ministry
Though
Der
Sieg
des
Glaubens
apparently
did
well
at
the
box
office
it
later
became
a
serious
embarrassment
to
the
Nazis
after
SA
Leader
Ernst
R
hm
who
had
a
prominent
role
in
the
film
was
executed
during
the
Night
of
the
Long
Knives
All
references
to
R
hm
were
ordered
to
be
erased
from
German
history
which
included
the
destruction
of
all
copies
of
Der
Sieg
des
Glaubens
It
was
considered
lost
until
a
copy
turned
up
in
the
1990s
in
the
United
Kingdom
In
1934
Riefenstahl
had
no
wish
to
repeat
the
fiasco
of
Der
Sieg
des
Glaubens
and
initially
recommended
fellow
director
Walter
Ruttmann
Ruttmann
s
film
which
would
have
covered
the
rise
of
the
Nazi
Party
from
1923
to
1934
and
been
more
overtly
propagandistic
the
opening
text
of
Triumph
of
the
Will
was
his
did
not
appeal
to
Hitler
He
again
asked
Riefenstahl
who
finally
relented
there
is
still
debate
over
how
willing
she
was
after
Hitler
guaranteed
his
personal
support
and
promised
to
keep
other
Nazi
organizations
specifically
the
Propaganda
Ministry
from
meddling
with
her
film
Production
edit
The
film
follows
a
script
similar
to
Der
Sieg
des
Glaubens
which
is
evident
when
one
sees
both
films
side
by
side
For
example
the
city
of
Nuremberg
scenes
even
to
the
shot
of
a
cat
included
in
the
city
driving
sequence
in
both
films
Furthermore
Herbert
Windt
reused
much
of
his
musical
score
for
that
film
in
Triumph
des
Willens
which
he
also
scored
Riefenstahl

With
that
said
there
were
extensive
preparations
facilitated
by
the
cooperation
of
party
members
the
military
and
vital
help
from
high
ranking
Nazis
like
Goebbels
As
Susan
Sontag
observed
The
Rally
was
planned
not
only
as
a
spectacular
mass
meeting
but
as
a
spectacular
propaganda

Albert
Speer
Hitler
s
personal
architect
designed
the
set
in
Nuremberg
and
did
most
of
the
coordination
for
the
event
Pits
were
dug
in
front
of
the
speakers
platform
so
Riefenstahl
could
get
the
camera
angles
she
wanted
and
tracks
were
laid
so
that
her
cameramen
could
get
traveling
shots
of
the
crowd
When
rough
cuts
weren
t
up
to
par
major
party
leaders
and
high
ranking
public
officials
reenacted
their
speeches
in
a
studio
for
her
10
Riefenstahl
also
used
a
film
crew
that
was
extravagant
by
the
standards
of
the
day
Her
crew
consisted
of
172
people
including
10
technical
staff
36
cameramen
and
assistants
operating
in
16
teams
with
30
cameras
nine

26

37
security

four

workers
and
two
office
assistants
Many
of
her
cameramen
also
dressed
in
SA
uniforms
so
they
could
blend
into
the
crowds
Riefenstahl
had
the
difficult
task
of
condensing
an
estimated
61
hours
of
film
into
two
hours
6
She
labored
to
complete
the
film
as
fast
as
she
could
going
so
far
as
to
sleep
in
the
editing
room
filled
with
hundreds
of

of

of

Themes
edit
Religion
edit
This
morning
s
opening
meeting
was
more
than
a
gorgeous
show
it
also
had
something
of
the
mysticism
and
religious
fervor
of
an
Easter
or
Christmas
Mass
in
a
great
Gothic
cathedral
Reporter
William
Shirer
Triumph
of
the
Will
is
sometimes
seen
as
an
example
of
Nazi
political
religion
The
primary
religion
in
Germany
before
the
Second
World
War
was
Christianity
With
the
primary
sects
being
Roman
Catholic
and
Protestant
the
Christian
views
in
this
movie
are
clearly
meant
to
allow
the
movie
to
better
connect
with
the
intended
audience
Religion
is
a
major
theme
in
Triumph
of
the
Will
The
film
opens
with
Hitler
descending
god
like
out
of
the
skies
past
twin
cathedral
spires
It
contains
many
scenes
of
church
bells
ringing
and
individuals
in
a
state
of
near
religious
fervor
as
well
as
a
prominent
shot
of
Reich
Protestant
Bishop
Ludwig
M
ller
standing
in
his
vestments
among
high
ranking
Nazis
It
is
probably
not
a
coincidence
that
the
final
parade
of
the
film
was
held
in
front
of
the
Nuremberg
Frauenkirche
In
his
final
speech
in
the
film
Hitler
also
directly
compares
the
Nazi
party
to
a
holy
order
and
the
consecration
of
new
party
flags
by
having
Hitler
touch
them
to
the
blood
banner
has
obvious
religious
overtones
Hitler
himself
is
portrayed
in
a
messianic
manner
from
the
opening
where
he
descends
from
the
clouds
in
a
plane
to
his
drive
through
Nuremberg
where
even
a
cat
stops
what
it
is
doing
to
watch
him
to
the
many
scenes
where
the
camera
films
from
below
and
looks
up
at
him
Hitler
standing
on
his
podium
will
issue
a
command
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
followers
The
audience
happily
complies
in
unison
11
As
Frank
P
Tomasulo
comments
Hitler
is
cast
as
a
veritable
German
Messiah
who
will
save
the
nation
if
only
the
citizenry
will
put
its
destiny
in
his
hands
12
Power
edit
It
is
our
will
that
this
state
and
this
Reich
shall
endure
through
the
coming
millennia
Hitler
Germany
had
not
seen
images
of
military
power
and
strength
since
the
end
of
World
War
I
and
the
huge
formations
of
men
would
remind
the
audience
that
Germany
was
becoming
a
great
power
once
again
Though
the
Labor
Service
men
carried
spades
they
handled
them
as
if
they
were
rifles
The
Eagles
and
Swastikas
could
be
seen
as
a
reference
to
the
Roman
Legions
of
antiquity
The
large
mass
of
well
drilled
party
members
could
be
seen
in
a
more
ominous
light
as
a
warning
to
dissidents
thinking
of
challenging
the
regime
Hitler
s
arrival
in
an
airplane
should
also
be
viewed
in
this
context
According
to
Kenneth
Poferl
Flying
in
an
airplane
was
a
luxury
known
only
to
a
select
few
in
the
1930s
but
Hitler
had
made
himself
widely
associated
with
the
practice
having
been
the
first
politician
to
campaign
via
air
travel
Victory
reinforced
this
image
and
defined
him
as
the
top
man
in
the
movement
by
showing
him
as
the
only
one
to
arrive
in
a
plane
and
receive
an
individual
welcome
from
the
crowd
Hitler
s
speech
to
the
SA
also
contained
an
implied
threat
if
he
could
have
R
hm
the
commander
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
troops
on
the
screen
shot
it
was
only
logical
to
assume
that
Hitler
could
get
away
with
having
anyone
executed
Unity
edit
As
soon
as
our
own
propaganda
admits
so
much
as
a
glimmer
of
right
on
the
other
side
the
foundation
for
doubt
in
our
own
right
has
been
laid
Hitler
It
was
very
important
to
Adolf
Hitler
that
his
propaganda
messages
carry
a
unified
theme
If
a
country
isn
t
unified
in
saying
the
enemy
is
bad
the
audience
starts
to
have
doubts
Unity
is
seen
throughout
this
film
even
in
the
camps
where
soldiers
live
The
camp
outside
of
Nuremberg
is
very
uniform
and
clean
the
tents
are
aligned
in
perfect
rows
each
one
the
same
as
the
next
The
men
there
also
make
a
point
not
to
wear
their
shirts
because
their
shirts
display
their
rankings
and
status
Shirtless
they
are
all
equals
unified
When
they
march
it
is
in
unison
and
they
all
carry
their
weapons
identically
one
to
another
Hitler
s
message
to
the
workers
also
includes
the
notion
of
unity
The
concept
of
labor
will
no
longer
be
a
dividing
one
but
a
uniting
one
and
no
longer
will
there
be
anybody
in
Germany
who
will
regard
manual
labor
any
less
highly
than
any
other
form
of
labor
Hitler
Children
were
also
used
to
convey
unity
We
want
to
be
a
united
nation
and
you
my
youth
are
to
become
this
nation
In
the
future
we
do
not
wish
to
see
classes
and
castes
and
you
must
not
allow
them
to
develop
among
you
One
day
we
want
to
see
one
nation
Hitler
Triumph
of
the
Will
has
many
scenes
that
blur
the
distinction
between
the
Nazi
Party
the
German
state
and
the
German
people
Germans
in
peasant
farmers
costumes
and
other
traditional
clothing
greet
Hitler
in
some
scenes
The
torchlight
processions
though
now
associated
by
many
with
the
Nazis
would
remind
the
viewer
of
the
medieval
Karneval
celebration
The
old
flag
of
Imperial
Germany
is
also
shown
several
times
flying
alongside
the
Swastika
and
there
is
a
ceremony
where
Hitler
pays
his
respects
to
soldiers
who
died
in
World
War
I
as
well
as
to
President
Paul
von
Hindenburg
who
had
died
a
month
before
the
convention
There
is
also
a
scene
where
the
Labor
Servicemen
individually
call
out
which
town
or
area
in
Germany
they
are
from
reminding
the
viewers
that
the
Nazi
Party
had
expanded
from
its
stronghold
in
Bavaria
to
become
a
pan
German
movement
The
Party
is
Hitler
and
Hitler
is
Germany
just
as
Germany
is
Hitler
Rudolf
Hess
Hitler
s
speeches
edit
Among
the
themes
presented
the
desire
for
pride
in
Germany
and
the
purification
of
the
German
people
is
well
exemplified
through
the
speeches
and
ideals
of
the
Third
Reich
in
Triumph
of
the
Will
The
Totenehrung
honouring
of

at
the
1934

Hall
of
Honour

the

In
the
background
is
the
crescent
shaped
Ehrentrib
ne
literally
tribune
of
honour
In
every
speech
given
and
shown
in
Triumph
of
the
Will
pride
is
one
of
the
major
focuses
Hitler
advocates
to
the
people
that
they
should
not
be
satisfied
with
their
current
state
and
they
should
not
be
satisfied
with
the
descent
from
power
and
greatness
Germany
has
endured
since
World
War
I
The
German
people
should
believe
in
themselves
and
the
movement
that
is
occurring
in
Germany
Hitler
promotes
pride
in
Germany
through
the
unification
of
it
Unifying
Germany
would
force
the
elimination
of
what
does
not
amount
to
the
standards
of
the
Nazi
regime
To
unify
Germany
Hitler
believes
purification
would
have
to
take
place
This
meant
not
only
eliminating
the
citizens
of
Germany
who
are
not
of
the
Aryan
race
but
the
sick
weak
handicapped
or
any
other
citizens
deemed
unhealthy
or
impure
In
Triumph
of
the
Will
Hitler
preaches
to
the
people
that
Germany
must
take
a
look
at
itself
and
seek
out
that
which
does
not
belong
T
he
elements
that
have
become
bad
and
therefore
do
not
belong
with
us
Though
within
the
context
he
seems
to
be
referring
to
the
corrupt
elements
of
the
power
structure
it
later
could
seem
in
hindsight
to
imply
that
the
elimination
of
the
inferior
people
of
Germany
would
in
theory
return
Germany
to
its
once
prideful
and
powerful
former
self
dubious
discuss
Julius
Streicher
stresses
the
importance
of
purification
in
his
speech
a
direct
reference
to
his
own
virulent
anti
semitism
Hundreds
of
thousands
mentally
sick
and
disabled
would
be
murdered
in
the
Action
T4
a
programme
run
directly
from
Hitler
s
Chancellery
Kanzlei
des
F
hrers
Hitler
preaches
to
the
people
in
his
speeches
that
they
should
believe
in
their
country
and
themselves
The
German
people
are
better
than
what
they
have
become
because
of
the
impurities
in
society
Hitler
wants
them
to
believe
in
him
and
believe
what
he
wants
to
do
for
his
people
and
what
he
is
doing
is
for
the
country
s
and
people
s
benefit
Hess
says
in
the
last
scene
of
Triumph
of
the
Will
Heil
Hitler
hail
victory
hail
victory
Everyone
in
attendance
yells
in
support
This
verbal
sign
represents
their
faith
to
their
leader
and
his
most
trusted
advisors
that
they
believe
in
the
Nazi
cause
This
is
directly
following
Hitler
s
yell
Long
live
the
National
Socialist
Movement
Long
live
Germany
and
the
crowd
erupts
with
cheering
and
the
fulfillment
of
pride
for
themselves
and
their
political
party
In
the
closing
speech
of
Triumph
of
the
Will
Hitler
enters
the
room
from
the
back
appearing
to
emerge
from
the
people
After
a
one
sentence
introduction
he
tells
his
faithful
Nazis
how
the
German
nation
has
subordinated
itself
to
the
Nazi
Party
because
its
leaders
are
mostly
of
Germans
He
promises
that
the
new
state
that
the
Nazis
have
created
will
endure
for
thousands
of
years
Hitler
says
that
the
youth
will
carry
on
after
the
old
have
weakened
They
close
with
a
chant
Hitler
is
the
Party
Hitler
The
camera
focuses
on
the
large
Swastika
above
Hitler
and
the
film
ends
with
the
images
of
this
Swastika
imposed
on
Nazis
marching
in
a
few
columns
His
speech
brought
attention
to
the
rally
and
created
a
huge
turnout
in
the
following
years
He
attracted
many
people
in
the
way
that
he
addressed
the
issues
and
his
people
He
spoke
to
them
as
if
it
were
a
sermon
and
engaged
the
people
In
1934
over
a
million
Germans
participated
in
the
Nuremberg
Rally
Response
edit
Triumph
of
the
Will
premiered
on
28
March
1935
at
the
Berlin
Ufa
Palace
Theater
and
was
an
instant
success
Within
two
months
the
film
had
earned
815
000
Reichsmark
and
Ufa
considered
it
one
of
the
three
most
profitable
films
of
that
year
Hitler
praised
the
film
as
being
an
incomparable
glorification
of
the
power
and
beauty
of
our
Movement
For
her
efforts
Riefenstahl
was
rewarded
with
the
German
Film
Prize
Deutscher
Filmpreis
a
gold
medal
at
the
1935
Venice
Biennale
and
the
Grand
Prix
at
the
1937
World
Exhibition
in
Paris
However
there
were
few
claims
that
the
film
would
result
in
a
mass
influx
of
converts
to
fascism
and
the
Nazis
apparently
did
not
make
a
serious
effort
to
promote
the
film
outside
of
Germany
Film
historian
Richard
Taylor
also
said
that
Triumph
of
the
Will
was
not
generally
used
for
propaganda
purposes
inside
the
Third
Reich
The
Independent
wrote
in
2003
Triumph
of
the
Will
seduced
many
wise
men
and
women
persuaded
them
to
admire
rather
than
to
despise
and
undoubtedly
won
the
Nazis
friends
and
allies
all
over
the
world
13
The
reception
in
other
countries
was
not
always
as
enthusiastic
British
documentarian
Paul
Rotha
called
it
tedious
while
others
were
repelled
by
its
pro
Nazi
sentiments
During
World
War
II
Frank
Capra
helped
to
create
a
direct
response
through
the
film
series
called
Why
We
Fight
a
series
of
newsreels
commissioned
by
the
United
States
government
that
spliced
in
footage
from
Triumph
of
the
Will
but
recontextualized
it
so
that
it
promoted
the
cause
of
the
Allies
instead
Capra
later
remarked
that
Triumph
of
the
Will
fired
no
gun
dropped
no
bombs
But
as
a
psychological
weapon
aimed
at
destroying
the
will
to
resist
it
was
just
as
lethal
14
Clips
from
Triumph
of
the
Will
were
also
used
in
an
Allied
propaganda
short
called
General
Adolph
Takes
Over
15
set
to
the
British
dance
tune
The
Lambeth
Walk
The
legions
of
marching
soldiers
as
well
as
Hitler
giving
his
Nazi
salute
were
made
to
look
like
wind
up
dolls
dancing
to
the
music
The
Danish
resistance
used
to
take
over
cinemas
and
force
the
projectionist
to
show
Swinging
the
Lambeth
Walk
as
it
was
also
known
Erik
Barrow
has
said
The
extraordinary
risks
were
apparently
felt
justified
by
a
moment
of
savage
anti
Hitler
ridicule
16
Also
during
World
War
II
the
poet
Dylan
Thomas
wrote
a
screenplay
for
and
narrated
These
Are
The
Men
a
propaganda
piece
using
Triumph
of
the
Will
footage
to
discredit
Nazi
leadership
One
of
the
best
ways
to
gauge
the
response
to
Triumph
of
the
Will
was
the
instant
and
lasting
international
fame
it
gave
Riefenstahl
The
Economist
said
it
sealed
her
reputation
as
the
greatest
female
filmmaker
of
the
20th
century
17
For
a
director
who
made
eight
films
only
two
of
which
received
significant
coverage
outside
of
Germany
Riefenstahl
had
unusually
high
name
recognition
for
the
remainder
of
her
life
most
of
it
stemming
from
Triumph
of
the
Will
However
her
career
was
also
permanently
damaged
by
this
association
After
the
war
Riefenstahl
was
imprisoned
by
the
Allies
for
four
years
for
allegedly
being
a
Nazi
sympathizer
and
was
permanently
blacklisted
by
the
film
industry
When
she
died
in
2003
68
years
after
the
film
s
premiere
her
obituary
received
significant
coverage
in
many
major
publications
including
the
Associated
Press
18
The
Wall

Journal
19
The
New

Times
20
and
The

21
most
of
which
reaffirmed
the
importance
of
Triumph
of
the
Will
Though
the
actual
effectiveness
of
Triumph
of
the
Will
is
hard
to
measure
in
terms
of
numbers
or
statistics
that
actually
state
its
effectiveness
its
response
from
the
people
is
well

with
the

the

Controversy
edit
Julius
Streicher
in
custody
in
1945
Like
American
filmmaker
D
W
Griffith
s
The
Birth
of
a
Nation
Triumph
of
the
Will
has
been
criticized
as
a
use
of
spectacular
filmmaking
to
promote
a
profoundly
unethical
system
In
her
defense
Riefenstahl
claimed
that
she
was
na
ve
about
the
Nazis
when
she
made
it
and
had
no
knowledge
of
Hitler
s
genocidal
or
anti
semitic
policies
She
also
pointed
out
that
Triumph
of
the
Will
contains
not
one
single
anti
semitic
word
although
it
does
contain
a
veiled
comment
by
Julius
Streicher
the
notorious
Jew
baiter
who
was
hanged
after
the
Nuremberg
trials
that
a
people
that
does
not
protect
its
racial
purity
will
perish
However
Roger
Ebert
has
observed
that
for
some
the
very
absence
of
anti
semitism
in
Triumph
of
the
Will
looks
like
a
calculation
excluding
the
central
motif
of
almost
all
of
Hitler
s
public
speeches
must
have
been
a
deliberate
decision
to
make
the
film
more
efficient
as
propaganda
22
Riefenstahl
also
repeatedly
defended
herself
against
the
charge
that
she
was
a
Nazi
propagandist
saying
that
Triumph
of
the
Will
focuses
on
images
over
ideas
and
should
therefore
be
viewed
as
a
Gesamtkunstwerk
holistic
work
of
art
citation
needed
In
1964
she
returned
to
this
topic
saying
If
you
see
this
film
again
today
you
ascertain
that
it
doesn
t
contain
a
single
reconstructed
scene
Everything
in
it
is
true
And
it
contains
no
tendentious
commentary
at
all
It
is
history
A
pure
historical
film
it
is
film
v
rit
It
reflects
the
truth
that
was
then
in
1934
history
It
is
therefore
a
documentary
Not
a
propaganda
film
Oh
I
know
very
well
what
propaganda
is
That
consists
of
recreating
events
in
order
to
illustrate
a
thesis
or
in
the
face
of
certain
events
to
let
one
thing
go
in
order
to
accentuate
another
I
found
myself
me
at
the
heart
of
an
event
which
was
the
reality
of
a
certain
time
and
a
certain
place
My
film
is
composed
of
what
stemmed
from
that
23
However
Riefenstahl
was
an
active
participant
in
the
rally
though
in
later
years
she
downplayed
her
influence
significantly
claiming
I
just
observed
and
tried
to
film
it
well
The
idea
that
I
helped
to
plan
it
is
downright
absurd
Ebert
states
that
Triumph
of
the
Will
is
by
general
consent
one
of
the
best
documentaries
ever
made
but
added
that
because
it
reflects
the
ideology
of
a
movement
regarded
by
many
as
evil
it
poses
a
classic
question
of
the
contest
between
art
and
morality
Is
there
such
a
thing
as
pure
art
or
does
all
art
make
a
political
statement
22
When
reviewing
the
film
for
his
Great
Movies
collection
Ebert
reversed
his
opinion
characterizing
his
earlier
conclusion
as
the
received
opinion
that
the
film
is
great
but
evil
and
calling
it
a
terrible
film
paralyzingly
dull
simpleminded
overlong
and
not
even
manipulative
because
it
is
too
clumsy
to
manipulate
anyone
but
a
true
believer
24
Susan
Sontag
considers
Triumph
of
the
Will
the
most
successful
most
purely
propagandistic
film
ever
made
whose
very
conception
negates
the
possibility
of
the
filmmaker
s
having
an
aesthetic
or
visual
conception
independent
of
propaganda
Sontag
points
to
Riefenstahl
s
involvement
in
the
planning
and
design
of
the
Nuremberg
ceremonies
as
evidence
that
Riefenstahl
was
working
as
a
propagandist
rather
than
as
an
artist
in
any
sense
of
the
word
With
some
30
cameras
and
a
crew
of
150
the
marches
parades
speeches
and
processions
were
orchestrated
like
a
movie
set
for
Riefenstahl
s
film
Further
this
was
not
the
first
political
film
made
by
Riefenstahl
for
the
Third
Reich
there
was
Victory
of
Faith
1933
nor
was
it
the
last
Day
of
Freedom
1935
and
Olympia
1938
Anyone
who
defends
Riefenstahl
s
films
as
documentary
Sontag
states
if
documentary
is
to
be
distinguished
from
propaganda
is
being
disingenuous
In
Triumph
of
Will
the
document
the
image
is
no
longer
simply
the
record
of
reality
reality
has
been
constructed
to
serve
the
image

Brian
Winston
s
essay
on
the
film
in
The
Movies
as
History
is
largely
a
critique
of
Sontag
s
analysis
Winston
argues
that
any
filmmaker
could
have
made
the
film
look
impressive
because
the
Nazis
mise
en
sc
ne
was
impressive
particularly
when
they
were
offering
it
for
camera
re
stagings
In
form
the
film
alternates
repetitively
between
marches
and
speeches
Winston
asks
the
viewers
to
consider
if
such
a
film
should
be
seen
as
anything
more
than
a
pedestrian
effort
Like
Rotha
he
finds
the
film
tedious
and
believes
anyone
who
takes
the
time
to
analyze
its
structure
will
quickly
agree
Wehrmacht
objections
edit
The
first
controversy
over
Triumph
of
the
Will
occurred
even
before
its
release
when
several
generals
in
the
Wehrmacht
protested
over
the
minimal
army
presence
in
the
film
Only
one
scene
the
review
of
the
German
cavalry
actually
involved
the
German
military
The
other
formations
were
party
organizations
that
were
not
part
of
the
military
The
opposition
of
the
generals
was
not
simply
out
of
personalized
pique
or
vanity
As
produced
by
Riefenstahl
Triumph
of
the
Will
posits
Germany
as
a
leaderless
mass
of
lost
souls
without
any
organizing
institutions
or
antecedent
institutional
leaders
And
that
the
new
order
embodied
by
the
Nazi
Party
and
Hitler
provides
a
both
new
and
a
singular
saving
leader
and
institutional
framework
for
the
whole
of
the
German
nation
However
the
Army
had
been
and
had
seen
itself
as
being
an
institution
that
held
shared
responsibility
for
the
leadership
of
the
nation
and
state
since
at
least
the
time
of
Fredrick
the
Great
The
leaders
of
that
Army
had
also
been
viewed
throughout
the
history
of
the
German
speaking
peoples
as
an
integral
part
of
the
leadership
cadre
By
omitting
the
Army
along
with
other
institutions
e
g
the
nobility
the
Church
academia
business
the
film
demonstrated
that
the
Army
as
well
as
its
leaders
was
disappeared
from
what
the
Army
considered
to
be
its
shared
leadership
role
in
the
state
National
Socialist
or
otherwise
The
Army
s
leaders
vehemently
disagreed
with
this
implied
assertion
of
the
film
Hitler
proposed
his
own
artistic
compromise
where
Triumph
of
the
Will
would
open
with
a
camera
slowly
tracking
down
a
row
of
all
the
overlooked
generals
and
placate
each
general
s
ego
According
to
her
own
testimony
Riefenstahl
refused
his
suggestion
and
insisted
on
keeping
artistic
control
over
Triumph
of
the
Will
She
did
agree
to
return
to
the
1935
rally
to
make
a
film
exclusively
about
the
Wehrmacht
which
became
Tag
der
Freiheit
Unsere
Wehrmacht

of
Freedom

Armed
Forces

for
its
striking
visuals
As
one
historian
notes
many
of
the
most
enduring
images
of
the
Nazi
regime
and
its
leader
derive
from
Riefenstahl
s
film
25
Extensive
excerpts
of
the
film
were
used
in
Erwin
Leiser
s
documentary
Mein
Kampf
produced
in
Sweden
in
1960
Riefenstahl
unsuccessfully
sued
the
Swedish
production
company
Minerva
Film
for
copyright
violation
although
she
did
receive
forty
thousand
marks
in
compensation
from
German
and
Austrian
distributors
of
the
film
26
In
1942
Charles
A
Ridley
of
the
British
Ministry
of
Information
made
a
short
propaganda
film
Lambeth
Walk
Nazi
Style
which
edited
footage
of
Hitler
and
German
soldiers
from
the
film
to
make
it
appear
they
were
marching
and
dancing
to
the
song

had

the
Nazis
denounced

27
so
enraged
Joseph
Goebbels
that
reportedly
he
ran

would

significant
footage
with
a
mocking
narration
in
the
first
installment
of
the
propagandistic
film
produced
by

Army
Why

as
an
exposure
of
Nazi
militarism
and
totalitarianism
to
American
soldiers

The
film
has
been
studied
by
many
contemporary
artists

directors
Peter

and

The
most
notable
use

is
found
in

Overview
edit
Although
German
constitutional
commentators
consider
only
the
Reichstag
and
now
the
Bundestag
to
be
the
German
parliament
in
fact
since
1871
Germany
has
been
governed
by
a
bicameral
legislature
of
which
the
Reichstag
served
as
a
lower
house
and
the
Reichsrat
after
1949
the
Bundesrat
as
the
upper
house
Constitutionally
the
Reichsrat
represented
the
governments
of
the
federal
German
states
According
to
the
1919
Weimar
Constitution
the
members
of
the
Reichstag
were
to
be
elected
by
general
universal
suffrage
according
to
the
principle
of
proportional
representation
Votes
were
cast
for
nationwide
party
lists
Elections
were
to
be
held
at
the
end
of
a
legislative
session
of
four
years
Because
of
some
special
requirements
there
were
still
inconsistencies
between
the
total
share
of
votes
received
by
a
party
and
its
share
of
the
seats
Hitler
was
not
in
power
yet
There
was
no
hard
and
fast
threshold
for
winning
a
seat
in
the
Reichstag
In
practice
a
party
could
do
so
with
as
little
as
0
4
percent
of
the
national
vote
one
seat
for
some
60
000
votes
While
this
provision
was
intended
to
reduce
wasted
votes
it
also
resulted
in
a
large
number
of
parties
being
represented
in
the
chamber
Combined
with
the
nationwide
party
list
system
this
made
it
extremely
difficult
to
form
a
stable
government
Moreover
each
political
party
wanted
to
pull
Germany
in
a
different
direction
and
parties
often
refused
to
compromise
with
or
even
recognize
other
parties
As
scholar
Erik
von
Kuehnelt
Leddihn
wrote
in
1943
Catholic
Centrists
wanted
to
create
conditions
in
Germany
which
would
make
it
easier
for
the
individuals
to
save
their
souls
Socialists
denied
the
existence
of
souls
and
divided
people
into
classes
the
German
Nationalists
were
interested
in
language
and
culture
while
the
National
Socialists
put
the
main
stress
on
race
Whereas
some
looked
at
pocketbooks
others
at
the
pigmentation
of
the
skin
or
the
index
of
the
skull
fruitful
discussions
became
impossible
When
the
speaker
of
one
party
indulged
in
his
oratory
the
others
walked
out
It
was
not
worth
while
to
listen
to
somebody
s
opinion
when
you
knew
that
his
premises
were
all
wrong
The
grim
determination
to
silence
the
unconvincible
enemy
by
execution
or
imprisonment
already
existed
prior
to
1933
in
many
parties
2
The
parliament
passed
legislation
and
the
government
budget
as
well
as
making
declarations
of
war
and
ratifying
international
treaties
The
members
of
the
German
cabinet
or
government
were
responsible
to
the
Reichstag
which
could
force
the
resignation
of
ministers
or
even
the
whole
cabinet
by
a
motion
of
no
confidence
It
could
also
revoke
emergency
decrees
by
the
Reich
President
according
to
Article
48
of
the
constitution
however
on
the
other
hand
the
President
was
able
to
dissolve
the
Reichstag
In
contrast
the
Reichsrat
the
house
of
state
representatives
had
minor
significance
The
constitution
also
provided
for
the
possibility
of
referenda
but
the
hurdles
to
overcome
were
high
There
were
only
two
plebiscites
in
1926
on
the
Expropriation
of
the
Princes
and
in
1929
on
the
Liberty
Law
against
the
Young
Plan
which
were
both
unsuccessful
Opening

Nazi
members
of
the
Reichstag
in

All
too
often
when
a
Chancellor
was
removed
from
office
his
replacement
was
well
short
of
a
majority
This
was
especially
pronounced
in
the
1930s
when
Chancellors
had
to
resort
to
Article
48
just
to
conduct
the
ordinary
business
of
government
In
the
election
of
1928
the
Nazi
Party
won
only
12
seats
in
the
Reichstag
making
it
the
smallest
of
the
nine
parties
in
the
chamber
However
over
the
following
two
years
it
gained
another
95
At
the
election
of
1932
the
Nazis
and
the
Communist
Party
both
declared
enemies
of
the
parliamentary
system
together
held
an
absolute
majority
of
the
seats
In
1920
1923
and
from
1930
onwards
the
parliament
was
often
circumvented
by
two
instruments
not
strictly
provided
for
by
the
constitution
the
extensive
use
of
powers
granted
to
the
President
by
the
use
of
the
Emergency
Decree
in
Article
48
of
the
constitution
the
use
of
enabling
acts
especially
in
1919
1923
and
then
again
the
Enabling
Act
of
1933
after
Hitler
had
been
appointed
Chancellor
which
formed
an
important
building
block
of
his
dictatorship
With
this
latter
enabling
act
the
Reichstag
formally
gave
up
its
exclusive
responsibility
for
the
exercise
of
the
legislative
power
From
then
on
the
German
parliament
only
functioned
as
a
one
party
assembly
and
as
a
body
which
ratified
the
actions
of
the
Nazi
dictatorship
by
acclamation
Even
in
its
purely
ceremonial
role
the
Third
Reich
s
Reichstag
convened
only
twenty
times
the
last
being
on
April
26
1942
On
January
25
1943
five
days
before
the
expiration
of
the
last
Reichstag
s
term
of
office
the
summoning
of

When
in
1948
1949
the
West
German
politicians
established
a
new
democracy
they
used
the
word
Bund
federation
in
place
of
Reich
in
German
constitutional
history
both
terms
were
almost
exchangeable
With
memories
of
how
the
Nazis
had
exploited
the
weaknesses
of
the
Reichstag
still
fresh
the
founders
of
the
new
state
built
in
several
safeguards
to
prevent
a
repeat
occurrence
The
new
parliament
became
the
Bundestag
elected
by
mixed
member
proportional
representation
a
mix
of
members
elected
from
individual
constituencies
and
state
party
lists
From
1949
to
qualify
for
seats
by
proportional
representation
a
party
must
either
win
at
least
five
percent
of
the
national
vote
or
else
win
three
directly
elected
seats
The
Chancellor
Bundeskanzler
must
be
elected
by
an
absolute
majority
in
the
Bundestag
and
could
only
be
removed
from
office
if
a
prospective
successor
was
already
assured
of
a
majority
Besides
the
Bundestag
the
Bundesrat
representing
the
governments
of
the
states
has
a
decisive
vote
on
legislation
where
the
states
interests
are
concerned

Reichstag
building
After
the
German
unification
of
1870
the
new
Reichstag
first
met
in
the
houses
of
the
Prussian
Landtag
in
Berlin
In
1871
it
decided
to
have
a
new
building
constructed
and
in
the
mean
time
had
its
base
in
a
former
porcelain
factory
at
number
4
Leipziger
Stra
e
Some
23
years
later
the
Reichstag
s
new
building
was
finished
and
it
was
opened
by
the
Emperor
in
1894
This
is
today
known
as
the
Reichstagsgeb
ude
or
as
the
Reichstag
After
the
building
was
severely
damaged
in
the
Reichstag
fire
of
February
1933
the
Nazi
Reichstag
met
in
the
nearby
Kroll
Opera
House
Towards
the
end
of
the
war
the
surviving
but
heavily
damaged
Reichstag
building
was
the
object
of
numerous
Soviet
attacks
because
it
was
seen
as
a
symbol
of
the
Third
Reich
They
hoisted
the
Red
Flag
just
in
time
for
the
Mayday
celebrations
of
1945
After
the
war
it
was
repaired
and
used
as
an
exhibition
hall
but
major
renovation
and
rebuilding
was
needed
for
the
new
German
Bundestag
Since
1999
the
German
Bundestag
has
used
the
former
Reichstag
as
its
permanent
building
Its
official
address
is
Platz
der
Republik
